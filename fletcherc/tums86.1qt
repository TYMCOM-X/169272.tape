Subject:  RESTRUCTURING OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS COMPUTER SYSTEMS 
          COMPANY AND DISSOLUTION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
          DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS COMPANY


We need to do everything we can to ensure the ISG meets its 1986 
revenue and earnings objectives.  In line with this need I am 
announcing, effective today, the following organizational changes:

o   The North American Marketing and Sales organization that 
    formerly reported within McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
    Systems Company is now part of McDonnell Douglas Computer 
    Systems Company.  This restructuring will better equip the 
    Computer Systems Company to compete in the business systems 
    marketplace while it continues to meet ISG's internal hardware 
    manufacturing needs.  The restructured company will be headed 
    up by Otis Brinkley as President, with Vern Smith as Executive 
    Vice President.  In the coming weeks, Otis and Vern will work 
    together to develop an optimal structure for the Computer 
    Systems Company.

o   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company has been 
    dissolved in an effort to narrow the range of our business 
    activities and focus more on profitability.  The business 
    units within the Distribution Systems Company have been 
    reassigned as follows:

    -     Our Commercial Distribution Systems and Electronic Data 
          Interchange businesses are now part of McDonnell Douglas 
          Diversified Information Systems Company.  As such, these 
          businesses will continue to pursue their 1986 Operating 
          Plan objectives.

    -     Our embryonic Retail Systems business is being assigned 
          to ISG Marketing and Planning, where it will continue to 
          develop its strategy, though at a much lower level of 
          investment than we had planned for the balance of 1986.





1'm confident that these actions will increase our chances of 
achieving our 1986 objectives.  I'm counting on you not only to 
support these moves, but to do whatever you can to ease the 
transition for the people affected by them.

    MCDONNELL DOUGLAS
INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP         BENEFITS FACT     March 1986



TO:           ALL ISG EMPLOYEES WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE


SUBJECT:      (l) Coordination of Benefits
              (2) Oral Surgery Coverage For Employees
                  Covered By A Health Maintenance Organization
              (3) Toll Free 800 Numbers To Group Insurance


Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  elected medical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

All employees entering VG1 and VG2 can do so through the
front lobby entrance.  This entrance will be open 24 hours

All employees should have their vehicles moved to the
appropriate spaces no later than 5:00 AM on 8 March 1986.
Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.
