As a result of the change in Secretaries I have been asked that we
adhere to the CSS policy regarding call-in pay.  The policy is
attached.  The major difference you will note from the procedure we 
have been following is that only the 2nd and succeeding call-ins
within a pay period are paid for at the $40 rate.

Effective with the pay period beginning Monday February 18, 1985
we will follow the CSS policy for call-in and standby pay.
