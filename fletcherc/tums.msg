o  Base crashes occurs at both Data Centers PDP10's.  Frequency of the
   crashes is about the same.  One of the enhancement we have in the
   que about TYMCOM-X and EBUS slot code is to eliminate some of these
   type of crashes: TTYBMT, TTYBPN, CNTPRT, ZAPBUG, BASE etc.

o  Yes, Joe is looking into FTACFC STOPCD crashes.

Subject: Created /B08 instead of /B07-1. 

As per discussion (with JMS, CARL, OSMAN, DENCOFF present), the fix system
38's FTACFC crash will not be distributed as a DDT patch.  Instead, /B08
will replace all copies of nnXB07.SAV.

The crash on F38 showed FTA3 was given a command, FTA1 interrupted while
waiting for FTA3 to finish so FTA1 was given a new command, then the unit
check on FTA3 was noticed.  Due to what appears to be a minor glitch in the
SA10 microcode, the pointer stored at memory location 300+2 implied FTA1
when the unit-check was reported for FTA3 at location 300+1.  This
inconsistancy caused the FTACFC stopcode, which is the same as KAF with
CH1's PC indicating a loop at PI channel 3 at SGPREV in FTASER.  The patch
is to set T4 to a reasonable value and return instead of getting stuck in
a very slow loop searching 256K for the bogus pointer.

P035/B04 includes the ability to run with AR/ARX parity trap enabled.
         It runs on systems with 365x disks.

P035/B06 fixes the problem of bogus "search errors" on systems with 3675 disks.

P035/B07 would normally be called P035/B06-1.  It fixes the problem of THUNGs
	 on systems with 3 strings on a single 3674 and on 3652 disks.

P035/B08 would normally be called P035/B06-2.  It allows the system to continue
	 after an FTACFC stopcode, which occurs only when unrecoverable read or
	 write errors occur on one FTA while a second FTA is doing I/O.

With the possible exception of system 39, we want to be running /B08 on all
systems in the Fremont Data Center.

      have a particular license, please say so.  If you have a particular
      need for more license than you have, please say so, and why.

      If you are a manager and require license only because one of your
      subordinates requires the license to do their job, please say so
      and specify the above information for each of your subordinates so
      they may be entered into the database.

Subject: Maximum jobs versus disks. 

Our current monitor configuration can handle only 32 jobs when 64 disks 
(8 strings) are defined.  Lowering the number of disks to 48 allows 80 jobs,
and with 32 disks 128 jobs can be handled.

These limits are based on the restriction currently in ONCE that the entire
monitor (including the symbol table) fit in 112K of unpaged core.

Subject: "Brought F29 up on NEWMON manually"... 

Brought F29 up on NEWMON (P035/B08) manually to rerun HS2287 ONTYME
accounting tape.  This was done to see if the system would cacrash with the same STOPCODE that occurred on 22 Jun.

After bringing the system up, I mounted this tape of FTA2
and started the restore.  I also mounted a tape on FTA1 and started
storing the directory of UTIL to it.

The accounting tape stopped after "Creating User Information" typed
out (same place as before).  The TITO tape stopped shortly after this.
Approximately one minute later, F29 went down with same "KAK" stopcode.

(That's KAF, not KAK)

I then dismounted the tapes and brought the  system up.  I have the
hardcopy if additional information is needed.

Rick


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks Rick.  This is very valuable information.  Please save the tape
that causes the crash.  We will be talking about this in our group meeting
this afternoon and come up with another patch/fix to the monitor to
fix the problem.

Subject: License disappears (sometimes) on RENAME. 

After reading Carl's message I did some testing.  I GFDed to SPL, and then,
without setting license, I tried ".RENAME COPY.S=COPY.SAV".  The file COPY.SAV
had JL and RF license before and after.  (And still after renaming back to
COPY.SAV.)  Then I tried ".RENAME (JMS)COPY.SAV=(SPL)COPY.SAV".  The license
disappeared when the file changed directories!  After reinstating JL and RF,
I tried renaming it the other direction, from my logged in directory to the
GFDed directory.  License went away.  One last test was to reset everything
and set WF only on my frame and then try renaming across directories.  This
time RF survived (since it is implied by WF) but JL did not.

Until today I did not know that license got left behind on a RENAME.  It is
not what I expected.  However the preservation of license when doing
 "RENAME (SYS)PROGRAM.OLD=(SYS)PROGRAM.SAV" is a feature worth preserving.

Subject: 8 of 10 crashes on 33 are SAXINX 

Most of F33's crashes are KAF stopcodes, but the crash dumps show that a
SAXINX info stopcode had just occurred and the info hadn't gotten a chance to
type out on the CTY.  One crash implied that the SA10 stopped working the
time it was determined that the SA10 caused the interrupt and the time the
status was read to determine which channel caused the interrupt.  The
changes to COMMOD in /B09 will get more information and try to continue.
Note: This does not affect F29's problem with reading ONTYME accounting.
That problem is still under investigation.     /Joe

and needs further study.  I will send another message later today.  /Joe

Subject: Found loop in FTASER. 

FTASER has several phases of "DC-R" recovery (DataCheck-Read).  Phase 1 is to
re-read the record forwards.  Phase 2 is to read the record backwards.  Phase 3
is to continue reading backwards if phase 2 worked but did not read the entire
record.  The calculation to determine where to resume reading misinterpreted
the command list and got into an infinite loop (causing KAF).  The check for
getting out of the loop failed if the current command list did not start at
the beginning of the area reserved for command lists.  The fix was to stop at
a zero word as well.

The system does not hang anymore.  However, the OSIRUS RESTORE program tries
to re-read the same record over and over again.  But that's its problem (or
possibly a misfeature in FOROTS).  P035/B10 will be put on F29 tonight, and
eventually all other systems in Fremont.    /Joe

Subject: Hotline (type) call 

System F30 was experiencing a rise in hard device errors on BPA6.  They
took the system down to do a PAKCOP of the pack (3675's) and saw the same
hardware check problem we had with system 38 two weeks ago.

Rick called and wanted to know if it was OK to use Joe's modified PAKCOP.
I said, go... and we realized that that version was for 3650's in blocks.
We decided to run ASP version 7 to copy out the pack to tape and then do
a restore to a new pack.

We did a compare of the save prior to the restore and found 78(*) pages that
did not copy exactly.  Nothing was done to see how "off" the pages were.
We restored the tapes to a new drive/pack and I created a file with 78 pages
in it for DSKCLN to find multiply used pages and mark the files bad.

System came up with a FULL DSKCLN and reported errors as expected in RECOV.SYS
and on the console.  One UFD was affected.  Operations has the list of files
from FNDBAD to restore and the UFD name to work through the all-files and
backups.

I told them to call us if they had any more problems.

We received a verbal "thanks" from both Bob Fischer and Cheryl Eldred for
saving them a rebuild.

The jury summons I received 3 weeks ago told me to call this weekend, to learn
if/when I have to report for actual jury duty.  My number, 51, is like such a
number was for the draft lottery:  an early choice.

I have to report to the San Jose Facility, Juror Assembly Annex, at 9:30 am,
Monday, June 26.  I'll let you know as soon as I know more about my schedule.

I hope I don't get a murder trial, like Bruce Ring did!

Subject: SETOP should clear input buffer if no DRWSPR.EPO file. 

There is a very small window between the time that PJ copies the new oper
password file to SYS and the time that it sets WC license on it.  If an MHX
job just happens to try to use "O$" during that time, SETOP complains that
there is "NO PASSWORD FILE" and exits without clearing the input buffer.
When this happenned to me today, my oper password showed up on the command
line where anyone looking over my shoulder could see.  Because of MEXEC, it
tried to run a program matching the first word of my oper password.  This
word was then made available to SYSTAT for the world to see.

This is not good.

Of course PJ should be fixed to specify the license in the enter rather
than doing a rename after the fact.  Aside from that, OPER should also
always take a password, regardless of weather there is an oper password
file or if its bad or if the name specified does not exist.  This is the
same strategy we'll be releasing in the network as soon as we get a round
tuit.  [it also makes guessing harder]  -Bill

Subject: Memo to Ed Roop about 32 disks. 

The following is in (M33)32DISK.MEM.  Whoever is going to the meeting in 
Solar Way at 13:00 on 7/02/87 can give copies to Roop, Fischer, etc.
			/Joe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the TYMCOM-X Support Group.
In reference to memo from Ed Roop dated June 4, 1987.

We are currently running a monitor with 32 disk addresses defined.  F74
has 29 active spindles disks, F38 had 28 active disks before it was
converted.  Running with 32 units of model 3675 disks is not a problem.

We have run a test monitor configured for a 3652 system with 32 addresses
and a test monitor configured for a 3652 system with 64 addresses.
Although only 1 string of 3652 disks was connected at the time, we see no
problems with using a second string of 3652 disks due to the uniformity
of disk addressing.  All 32 addresses go through the same 3674 controller.

Due to the current limitation on the size of the resident monitor, a
system can be configured for more than 32 addresses only at the expense
of the number of jobs the system can handle.

        A monitor with 32 disks can be defined with 128 jobs.
        A monitor with 48 disks can be defined with  80 jobs.
        A monitor with 64 disks can be defined with  32 jobs.

Note that each additional string of 3652 disks (with 16 addresses)
reduces the maximum number of jobs by 48.  There is an absolute maximum
of 64 units per structure.  Defining the DSKB structure with more than
32 units is not recommended.  Recovering from an HDA failure on a 48 unit
DSKB would take more than 48 hours of down-time.

Unless the sytems were to use multiple structures, we cannot recommend
attaching more than 32 disk units per CPU.

Subject: Host numbers!!! 

We (finally) received the host numbers we ordered back in May.  We ordered
four 2-digit host numbers for PDP-10 development use.  We received...

    14, 14, 16 and 17 for our use

We also received, in late May, four 4-digit host numbers for our use.
(I don't have these handy, but will save them away for later).

With these 8 numbers, and the ones we already have, we should be able
to configure our micronet with printer devices accessible from the real
network.

Craig,

  We've talked of the enhancements to TUMS which I use, but not in enough
detail for me to show you their advantages.  The enhanced TUMS is simple,
use-friendly, and allows filing of messages into accessable locations, sorted
by the user's own desired filing schema.  I believe it may meet your needs.

  Here is how my use of TUMS appears:
.MAIL		; Frequently read new mail.

 . . .
		; Frequently (maybe daily, up to weekly):
.TUMS		; (To allow reading all messages out of the MAIL file, then
		; deleting the messages, or transferring them to a selected
		; subject-related file, or transferring them to a quarterly
		; archive file, or just leaving them in the current tums
		; "main" mail file.)
*RU		; "Read all Unread messages"
*<disposition command for 1st message>		; (see list of commands)
*<disposition command for next message>		; (see list of commands)
*<disposition command for next message>		; (see list of commands)
. . .
*<disposition command for last new message>	; (see list of commands)
*EX		; delete all "disposed of" files, and exit TUMS

Subject: PDP-11 Diagnostics 

Dennis,
  It is my impression that the node code loaded by NODLOD in *.IMG files
is an image copy made using LINK11 of code that runs in the PDP-11.  It
is also my impression that *.BND files are also possible to be built and
then loaded with LOADII.

  The hardware FE's have some standard diagnostics for PDP-11 based systems
which (on the 11's with disks or tapes) can be loaded and run.

  Do you know if the format of either the BND or IMG files is the same or
similar to the DEC standard diagnostics, and if it is reasonable to expect
that we could load these diagnostics from a TYMCOM-X system using NODLOD or
LOADII?

  If the formats are different, it may be possible (should be, anyway) to
convert them to either IMG or BND file format, and then load them into the
LSI's to run memory or other diagnostics in order to trace some of our
intermittant faults.

  I am asking, because this may be the method to use to try and diagnose
why the micronode at TRW keeps halting... the symptoms suggest a power-
supply problem, but I am unsure, and would like to try another route...
besides, it will give us a way to trace and fix the intermittant problems
we have with two of our micronodes.

  Once upon a time, we had a project to get the source
for the LSI-11 diags (yes, DEC sells them) and assemble them
using our PDP-11 assembler.  They could then be converted
to BND format.  However, since the normal method used by the
field people when the want to do diags is to read them from
mag tape using a portable TU-58, the project was dropped.  They are
also available on paper tape.

Subject: PDP-10 coding trick 

  In putting together my own octal print routine for my SETOP endeavor
I chose to combine the octal and decimal print routines into one.  This
had the side effect that octal numbers with the sign bit set became
a weird set of punctuation marks (since I had an unsigned print routine).

		  OOPS!

  If you start with a standard routine such as this...

  num = 1
  rem = num+1

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

  I came up with this interesting bit of code as a work around that I had
never encountered in any bag of PDP-10 coding tricks...

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
; ** begin trick **
	EXCH	num,rem			; setup number in remainder word
	SETZ	num,			; for 2-word divide instead
	LSHC	num,1			; shift sign (if any) to high word
	LSH	rem,-1			; shift low word back into position
	DIV	num,rad			; first divide, results same as IDIV
	CAIA				; or JRST .+2 to skip first divide
; ** end trick **
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

; Have you ever seen this used anywhere before?

PS.  TYMCOM-X only...
    replace
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)
	OUTCHR	num
    with
	OUTCHI	"0"(num)		; outchr immediate

In reference to F3's in training:  There is some confusion here as to how

($40,800 per year), another person was told $30,000 per month ($360,000

maintenance on four Engines, it's not worth it."  George King needs to see

Since (NEW11:57)ND6657.BND,ND6760.BND,ND2770.BND,ND0115.BND went away when
system 57 was shut down, I went to (NEW11:39) and telecopied the files to
(NEW11:38) and (NEW11:37).  This puts the required files on 3 consecutive
systems (37,38,39) in 3 locations (Dallas, Fremont, Bubbnet).  The TXS
micronet files in (CURR11), (OLD11), (DOC11), and (TOOLS11) have also been
copied from 39 to 38 and 37.

The ND####.BND files in (NEW11) on 62, 95, and 930 might not be correct, due
to changes in the routing table (which is not stable yet).

Dennis,
  (CURR11:930)RUFSC.MAC  is complete, showing all host and node links
for our micronet.  We do not have a kernel host # on BNET for 2346
(or have verified that 2346 is available as a node on bubbnet) and have
not getten a host number for the KS on bubbnet yet... but that will not
be needed until late October most probably anyway.

  Let us know when the code is ready so we can start reconfiguration.

Thanks again...

Joe ..

Do you see any problem running D56 with 200 ports.??
D56-P035/C is cut with 200 ports and ready come up with it, right?
Roy R. is asking us to come up with 200 port monitor first and
after couple of days, he will have network reload the base code
which is cut for 200 port.

Subject: IME crashes on D37 caused by low core getting corrupted. 

The immediate cause of the IME (Illegal Memory reference from Exec) was
due to the byte pointer at UPYUWM got changed from 001200,,374670 to
401202,,354670.  Bits 0 and 16 got set and bit 22 got cleared.  Several other
words in the vicinity of UPYUWM also got mangled - see below.

I think it was caused by the "SET AUTOLOGOUT" inactivity timer going off
while the user's context pages were swapped out.  This would not show up on 930
or 95 unless a bunch of memory hogs were logged in to force the idle job out.

You can delete all the previous messages about the crashes on D37 from the
inactivity timer.  The real problem is that INTKIL.PAT was not applied to
any of the /B, /B-1, /B01, or /B04 monitors inDallas.  The only system that
had the patch was D55.  SYSTEM.SAV has been patched now.  /Joe
