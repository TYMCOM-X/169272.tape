Some Fujitsu Eagle M2361A's may exhibit a problem requiring replacement
of a costly HDA.  To avoid making matters worse we must exercise
care before quoting maintenance on this hardware by determining the
revision level of the HDA on each drive.

If the rev level of the HDA is E0 or later, quote standard prices.

If the rev level of the HDA is prior to E0 (D or ...) do not quote
maintenace unless the customer agrees to have his drives brought up
to rev E0 by MDFSCO for time and materials.

Product Support and LOgistics are negotiating with Fujitsu to reduce
the cost of the replacemnt HDA (potentially to 0) whether required for
drives presently under contract or for potential new customers.



        or


Some Fujitsu Eagle M2361A drives may exhibit a problem requiring HDa
replacement after HDA's are transported.  If this occurs Fujitsu will
exchange the HDA at no cost to MDFSCO, but we must bear the labor cost
to remove and replace the HDA.  To recover this expected cost we must
raise the montly maintenance price from $105 to $125.



When quoting M2361A drive maintenance, quote new price of $125/month.
