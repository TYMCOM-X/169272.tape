     The Monthly Newsletter of the APPLIED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS COMPANY
     from
     ACS MARKETING PUBLICATIONS, Cupertino, CA . . . July 22, 1986
     ========================================================================
     
     
       . . . Tym/COMM 4.0 RELEASED AUGUST 6:  MORE FOR THE SAME PRICE . . .
     
     Tym/COMM 4.0 now offers more, but at a price that keeps this product
     competitive with CrossTalk and SmartModem.
     
     New features include...
     
     X.PC, an advanced async communications protocol that enables users to
     connect to up to 15 different hosts or network services
     TYMGEN, a simple menu-driven means to set parameters (a breeze for
     novice users)
     SNAPSHOT, a feature that "takes a picture" of scrolling data
     REPLAY, the feature that displays that picture
     
     Enhancements for the novice and the experienced Tym/COMM user:  improved
     menus, monitor color control, and 20 new procedure statements
     
     Tym/COMM's excellent support continues through the Customer Service
     Center 800 number and with a revised user's guide that documents the new
     features.
     
     All this for the competitive price of $295.  However, the other guys
     don't offer site licensing.  (Yet!)  According to product manager Rose
     Hayden, corporations want good discounts, and site licenses are an
     effective way to offer discounts.
     
     New data sheets accompanied the July NEWSFLASH.  Demo diskettes are
     available.  To learn more about the new features or to obtain a demo
     diskette, contact Rose Hayden at ACS.R/HAYDEN.
     
     
              . . . ONTYME VERSION 22:  JUST AROUND THE CORNER . . .
     
     The release of OnTyme Version 22 is scheduled for mid-August, 1986.  The
     new features are highlighted below:
     
     Pathway--enables users to access any computer on the TYMNET network
     XMODEM Protocol--provides error-free file transfer
     X.ONTYME--increases throughput, efficiency, and saves money
     The Reply command--sends the contents of the workspace to the original
     recipients of the message
     Subject line--the text supplied by the sender appears in the message
     header and all the message lists (in, out, old, long, short, etc.)
     
     For a more detailed description of Pathway, XMODEM, and X.ONTYME, please
     see the enclosed data sheet.

       . . . NATIONAL COTTON COUNCIL PILOT CLOSES--BIG ONTYME ACCOUNT . . .
     
     ACS Sales Specialist Diane Biegel and Sales Rep Claire Pribula closed an
     OnTyme application with the National Cotton Council of America for a
     pilot to run 9/86 through 1/87.
     
     The OnTyme pilot will enable the National Cotton Council, located in
     Memphis, Tennessee, to save time and money and to communicate between
     
     - farmers and the USDA
     - its staff members
     - dealers and customers of the cotton industry
     
     GTE Telemail came in with a figure 30% lower than ACS.  But ACS got the
     close due to our superior consulting services, our ability to address
     the National Cotton Council's long-term needs, and the fact that
     Telemail has inferior error checking.
     
     Pribula first called on the National Cotton Council in September '85.
     In May '86, she got the RFP.  She contacted Diane Biegel, and, with the
     help of Nancy Browning, Bill Price, Nancy Shelton, Nick Corsano, and the
     Customer Service Center, made the close in July '86.
     
     According to Nancy Browning, ACS Manager of Business Development, this
     foot in the door has great potential for big future business!
     
     
                  . . . HOW TO PREPARE A WINNING PROPOSAL . . .
     
               by Patt Christie, Sr. Section Mgr., Marketing Media
     
     How well you prepare proposals may determine the success of your
     organization.  Here are some suggested mechanics from a just-announced
     book written to help you market your services:
     
     * Begin each new section at the top of the page
     * Be sure that no section is more than three times the number of pages
       of any other section
     * Place the table of contents and a list of exhibits and appendixes in
       the front of the proposal
     * Try to limit lists to six items; make nine the maximum
     * Include exhibits in the text adjacent to where the exhibit is noted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     * Avoid acronyms, abbreviations, and colloquialisms.  Write for an
       uninformed audience that has moderate interest
     * Limit sentence length.  Sentences that run more than 30 words and
       contain more than two ideas are difficult to follow
     * Include a "you will receive" benefit statement for each "we will do"
       statement

                  . . . PUBS SYSTEM STILL SEMI-OPERATIONAL . . .
     
     All publications printed before May 1986 are still available through the
     Pubs system.  All new publications--and ACS has printed quite a few
     since then--are available by sending an OnTyme to ACS.B/RAYMOND or by
     writing to Bob Raymond at 20705 Valley Green Drive, Cupertino, CA
     95014.  Check the "New in Pubs" column to see what is new--a new
     OrderXchange brochure, a Tym/COMM 4.0 data sheet, a new OnTyme price
     schedule, several issues of "What's Selling?"  All are packaged by 25.
     
     ACS publishes many collateral pieces to assist your sales efforts.
     Check them out.
     
     
                      . . . FROM THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR . . .
     
     LEGENDS...
     
     How many basketball players can shoot, pass, and rebound?  How many
     football players can run, pass, and defend?  How many baseball players
     can run, hit, and pitch?
     
     How many ISG Sales Reps are maintaining existing business relationships,
     selling the big ticket items, and building a growing base of business?
     It's a lot to ask, but all three of these are critical to our long-term
     success.
     
     The pressure is on to close big opportunities before the end of the
     year.  It's business as usual -- right?  Come 1/1/87, you'll be asked
     "what have you done for me lately" by you-know-who!
     
     In between selling those "big ones," why not sell two or three pieces of
     ACS business?  Come January, you might have an "extra" $15,000/mo.  By
     June, with our nurturing, you've got $30,000/mo.  By year end, the
     combined ongoing revenue from these closes could be worth half a million
     dollars a year!
     
     
                  . . . XCHANGE CALENDARS STILL AVAILABLE . . .
     
     ACS still has some Xchange calendars available.  They cover from July 86
     to July 87, and they are available in lots of 10 from ACS.B/RAYMOND.
