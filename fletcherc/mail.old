                  TYMSHARE MANAGEMENT SEMINARS
                  ----------------------------
  
                (MANAGEMENT I AND MANAGEMENT II)
 
These workshops emphasize management philosophy and practice.  
The seminars are designed to produce an active exchange of infor-
mation among the participants while simultaneously providing 
proven techniques and approaches to handling management responsi-
bilities in a variety of organizations.
 
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:
-------------------
 
     -Provide an understanding of Tymshare's management philosophy 
      and a comparison of the corporate philosophy with 
      individual approaches/techniques.
 
     -Create an active exchange of information among managers and
      supervisors.
 
     -Develop/enhance basic individual knowledge and abilities in 
      management responsibilities from a corporate perspective.
 
     -Create a common understanding of the job of management.
 
     -Assist participants in identifying and planning personal 
      career development.
     
     -Define and further develop managerial needs and abilities 
      within the Information Systems Group.
 
NOTES:
------
 
These two seminars are very similar to the Tymshare Management 
Seminar offered in 1981-1983.  Several topics are covered in both 
seminars, although at different levels of detail and with 
different focuses.  Management I is a somewhat more elementary 
course than the original seminar, and provides more detailed 
information on the basics of being a manager or supervisor.  
Management II is somewhat more advanced than the original seminar 
and assumes that participants have mastered the basics of 
supervision.  Individuals who take Management I in 1984 should 
not plan on taking Management II until at least 1985.  (Course 
content detailed on the next two pages.)
 
Individuals considering taking Management I or II should also 
consider Phase I or Phase IV before deciding.  Read ONTYME file 
*** MTPD.Phase/I&IV for additional information.

                       PHASE I and  PHASE IV
                       ---------------------
                       (Two new ISG Programs)
 
These programs were developed by a task force of McAuto managers and 
trainers with assistance from Zenger-Miller, a Cupertino-based 
management development and consulting firm.  Phase I is the first of 
three 3-day courses designed for first level managers; managers who 
participate in phase I will be scheduled to attend phase II six 
months later, and phase III eight months after that.  Phase IV is the  
first of two 4-day courses designed for second level managers 
(managers who supervise other managers). Participants in Phase IV 
will be scheduled to attend phase V approximately six months later. 
 
Phases I, II, III, IV and V are pf the new ISG Management and 
Professional Development (M&PD) program which began on May 2, 1984.  
It is based on needs identified in the 1983 Yankelovich, Skelly and 
White attitude survey done within McAuto, and is modeled after 
similar programs at IBM, HP, 3M and GE. The M&PD program is designed 
to provide managers with the skills necessary to meet the 1990 ISG 
goals.  In time, these seminars will replace Tymshare's Management I 
and II seminars.
 
The workshop staffs for these programs are comprised of two ISG 
"Management Chair" trainers (experienced line managers), and a 
nutrition/exercise/stress/health consultant.  The course is 
"residential" -- accommodations (two to a room) are on the 
conference facility site.  This is an intensive course (7:30 am to 
7:00 pm), which does not allow time for participants to do work 
related to their regular job.  All workshops will be held near St. 
Louis. 
 
The only costs charges to a participants' cost center are for travel 
to St. Louis.  All costs for meals, lodging and trainer fees are 
charged to a central ISG budget. 
 
Descriptions of these courses are detailed on the following two 
pages.  To enroll in either of these seminars, type
":EXEC *** MTPD.ENROLL". Enrollment forms must be Ontymed to 
HRD.TRNG at least six weeks prior to the preferred course date.

                COUNSELOR SELLING SKILLS
              
                ------------------------    
 
 
This Wilson Learning Corporation seminar has been conducted in 
recent years for the Computer Management Services Group, and is 
now available to selected sales personnel in other Tymshare 
organizations.
 
Counselor Selling is divided into five sections including the 
ORIENTATION which introduces sales people to the practice of 
seeing things from the buyer's point of view.  Participants build 
skills in helping customers work through the four phases of the 
selling process:
 
     - In the RELATING Process course participants gain in-depth 
       skills for overcoming the most difficult obstacle to 
       selling - NO TRUST.
 
     - The DISCOVERY Process aids salespeople in developing 
       listening and questioning skills so they can conduct 
       accurate needs analyses and overcome the obstacle of NO HELP.
 
     - The ADVOCATING Process teaches salespeople how to develop    
       strategies for presenting to various kinds of buyers.  This 
       segment of the program helps salespeople overcome the 
       obstacle of NO NEED.
 
     - The SUPPORTING Process enables salespeople to ask for the   
       order - and to ask again, if necessary - to support a buying   
       decision and overcome the obstacle of NO HURRY.
 
Each participant receives pre- and post-course feedback.  Wilson 
Learning will provide each salesperson with an anonymous, non
judgmental statement on his or her performance compiled from 
profiles filled out by five clients that the salesperson selects 
before attending course sessions.  Post-course feedback profiles 
are also provided for each participant in Counselor Selling.  
These forms can be given to clients to obtain feedback on how 
newly learned skills are being applied.
 
Counselor Selling gives salespeople the competencies they need 
to:
 
     - Increase volume per sales call by better identifying   
       clients' and prospects' real needs.
 
     - Increase penetration of existing accounts by overcoming   
       the obstacles to a purchasing decision.
 
     - Avoid slumps and personal plateaus by analyzing and improving   
       their own performance.
 
     - Overcome call reluctance by exercising increased self-  
       confidence gained from understanding the buyer's point of   
       view.

     - Increase enjoyment of making calls by knowing how to be on   
       the side of customer - knowing what it takes to build a   
       "win/win" relationship.
 
     - Increase total sales volume by using the appropriate   
       skills required to support a buying decision.
 
     - Build a better and more long-term clientele by understanding 
       how to establish comfortable buying relationships, built 
       on trust.
 
     - Reduce the time spent building credibility in the mind of 
       the purchaser by knowing what steps to take to establish a 
       knowledgeable image.
 
     - Project the image of a dedicated, professional problem 
       solver - a counselor - whose first priority is to meet the  
       client's needs.

Subject: Meeting with Mallinckrondt

Craig,
  The meeting might be a good idea, and I'd have no real scheduling
problems with any dates until the end of October (when my moving becomes
imminent).  First, meeting here, with possibly a conference call to
Sue (and/or) Hank to outline and discuss what the customer needs and
wants would be best.  TYMCOM-X really will not have any problems with
more lines, so from the communications aspect, TYMNET will have to "handle"
that.  The only bottleneck will be "how much" MAGNUM will they want to
run,how many jobs, etc...  We understand a maximum of 15-20 jobs running

   Unlikely.  It is a fist for a customer... but, 930 & 118 used to

    I am not feeling too good, what ever my wife and daughter have ,it
looks like I caught it too. Tired, itchy throat, nagging cough.
My daughter wasn't getting well, (breathing problem) took her to
emergency Sunday night and they kept her there, so she will be in the 
hospital for two or three days. I will be staying home (working from 
home) for the next day or two. I though you might want to know.

Craig,
  yesterday's meeting with Roy & Mike went OK.  I didn't do much but to
give them an explanation of the way TYMCOM-X works internally.  They left
with a good impression of our group and the feeling that we were here to
provide them support if they need it.  I also clarified the support-line
and hot-line for them and told them of our impending move.

  I thought that you were going to be there?  were you? (but couldn't find
us? the room?) ....

  Tomorrow's meeting with Nick and Dennis, is someone co-ordinating it?
Do we all know what we are going to be discussing?  Should I call Hank or
Sue in St. Louis to talk with them first?  My uderstanding is that we need
to provide support & keep them happy until they can move to a VAX next year.
Also, that they want more lines (another micro-node), that's all.

Subject: Peak, Vue

Craig,
   There is a long "soap opera" story about VUE and PEAK.  It goes like
this:  When I worked at my Gallaudet College in Washington DC, a friend
of mine from SRI, known from the ARPA-NET and from his work on DEAF-NET
sent me mail about an EMACS for TOPS-10 available from Carnegie Mellon
(CMU).  I contacted the author, Mike Kazar @ CMU and arranged for getting
a copy of the sources for Gallaudet.  Another CMU student was working at
NIH for the summer and gave me his tape with the sources on it.  Thus, I
made it work for vanilla TOPS-10 (instead of CMU TOPS-10) and proceeded
to use this wonderful editor named "FINE".

   Next, when I went on vacation later that year in Tucson, AZ, I stopped
by at CMU and met the author, and he gave me another tape, with the only
real understanding that the program was not to be had for commercial use
and we'd arrange for updates in the future.  He also brought up the fact
that he was going to sell the program to a company, UNILOGIC, and that at
that time I'd have to start dealing with them.  I went to Arizona and put
the editor up at the University of Arizona, making it work on their types
of terminals.  I then went back to Gallaudet and re-installed the newest
version there shortly before I came to Tymshare.

   Then I came to Tymshare and brought my revised tapes with me.  I used
the installation of VUE as my tutorial about TYMCOM-X.  In 1 month I had
a version which ran, 2 months a version which other people could use, and
in 6 months a transmitted product for internal Tymshare use with a new
name, VUE - Virtually Unsupported Editor, complete with a user reference
manual and some help guides.

   During this 6 month period, I had contacted Kazar via ARPA-NET and he
put me in touch with Unilogic.  My copy was not bound by anything but a
verbal agreement with Mike Kazar.  The president of UNILOGIC, however was
some kind of lawyer and said that if we didn't remove "FINE" (as it was
still called) from all of our systems, we'd be involved in a court suit
about copyright infringement.

   Well..well...well, since I'd put so much effort and time into revising
major parts of the program, adding features, etc (all of which I initially
intended to "GIVE" to UNILOGIC, before their outburst), I had no reason to
worry about copyright infringement.  The copy I had was 1) prior to the
version given to UNILOGIC and 2) minimally 20-40% changed in code and the
comments.  [My understanding was that 20% modification to any work was more
than enough to make it an entirely different item, and thus not bound by
any copyright.]  Anyway, I never heard another word from UNILOGIC and I did
not try to contact them or Mike Kazar since that time.  However, it was
decided not to release that version of FINE, and to wait until I had made
further modifications and to release the program as VUE at that time.  We
talked with the Tymshare attourneys and they felt that we didn't really have
any worries, but that we didn't want to drag Tymshare into a legal suit.

  A nother player in this drama, Dave W. Smith, recently hired at the time,
came from Lawrence Livermore Labs where they too had a copy of FINE and they
too had been threatened with a law suit from UNILOGIC.  His info was that as
a company, UNILOGIC wanted to make money, but were full of hot air as far as
the pursuit of law suits against "bootlegged" copies of software available
on the ARPA-NET, (which is where we both got our copies).

   Dave also toyed with the idea of writing an editor and started to re-write
major portions of his version of FINE (written in BLISS-10) into SAIL.  So
that, when he was finished, Tymshare would have no problems trying to market
it.  His editor was called DED (Dave's EDitor), and eventually became PEAK
after a naming contest.  PEAK was not released to the public because it had
too many "hacks" in it and was prone to "bugs" due to code which had never
been fully thought out.  It was released for internal use, when a few people
outside our group had heard about it and Dave wanted someone to "pound" on
it to find the bugs.  One of these people was in marketing and wanted to let
one of her customers use DED.  That's when the list of legal customers was
added and only people with the Tymshare bit, or on the legal-gan list can
use DED with it's new name PEAK.

   This was also the point at which the department managers got together and
decided it would be better to put our efforts into making a product out of
DED/PEAK rather than any pursuit of VUE.  Since VUE was an "on my own time"
project, I agreed (under a little duress) and when asked, I'd tell people to
use PEAK, since it was "supposed" to be supported.

   A month or so later, Dave Smith left the company and the PEAK program was
turned over to Ken Dawson to maintain.  Ken and I have since gone 'round and
'round on various aspects of editor technology and re-written various parts
of PEAK to make it more reliable.  Features that I wanted were added by Ken
and sometimes, I'd borrow a copy and make a major modification, and then Ken
would incorporate it into his version after careful scrutiny.

   Now that Ken has left the company, I am the sole person left that knows
the principle ideas behind the two editors, both PEAK and VUE, and also the
internals of each.  VUE is written in BLISS-10 and MACRO-10.  PEAK is written
entirely in SAIL, with sprinkles of "START!CODE" throughout for speed.

   PEAK is in good shape for fixing bugs in it, or adding some new features.
VUE sources are in a state of distress at the moment, since I began a major
overhaul re-write a year ago and stopped short of completion, then began to
revamp it completely.  If (when) I do finish my overhaul, VUE will probably
be our best bet as an editor, with less problems than PEAK.  However, in the
meantime PEAK can also be made to run on TOPS-20 (although who needs it if
there's EMACS).  MAGNUM paid for getting PEAK to run on TOPS-20 when they
were pushing for a TOPS-20 MAGNUM, which we all know died due to no market.

   That is the basic story.  I left out a lot of un-important detail, which
I'd be happy to fill you in on verbally.  Both products are widely used in
the company.  TYMNET even has classes on how to use VUE.  Most of the PEAK
users are in the TYMSHARE part of the company....

   Sigh... I'm getting garbled... What exactly did you want to know?

The file (CRASH:930) now contains a thorough cross-reference for the
save'd crash files since March '84 on all TYMCOM-X systems (not counting
KS-2020's on customer sites).

The file is arranged as follows:

  Page 1 -- Summary by: OPS-Center, CPU-Type, Monitor-name

  Page 2 -- Summary by: Module:Address

  Pages 3-n Detailed summary of each stopcode with one page per module,
            showing monthly accumulations cross-referenced by OPS-center,
            cpu-type and monitor name.

It is currently about 18 pages long, with 1/2 of that being whitespace
between entries... (approx 8-10 pages if you remove form-feeds).  I will
attempt to make sure that this file is kept up-to-date by myself or Osman.

Subject: Fun-packed weekend (So far...)

In the past 20 hours, I've taken 5 hotline calls.  See HOTLIN.LOG for
details.  I'm only mentioning this because 2 of them should never have
been called in, 2 of them were bad files which weren't critical enough
to call the hotline for (or weren't "our" problem) and the only one that
was really valid was a hung system that I got involved with by checking
up on previous problems from Friday!

Also, the answering service has slipped again in calling our beepers!
Only the last call had anything on my display.  Two calls made in the
early am, 8:40ish & 9:11 were only relayed to me together at 11:00ish
due to a very busy morning at the answering service.  I don't know if
we want to take corrective action, or just log the fact that these did
happen today.

Ciao... see you both later.

Subject: Dallas, Frecor problems, etc.


Craig,
  I was going to wait a few days until we had a better handle on this
problem, but it seems that other groups are being affected and Osman
and I feel that you should be kept informed...

  We "know" that we have a system problem which locks up FRECOR without
properly releasing it.  We don't know what might be causing it.  it has
been seen even on system 930, but we were under the impression that it
was a disk problem (we, the old monitor group, now gone).  It has shown
up on system 56 and caused at least one system hang.

  I've talked to Roy Roskilly about all of this, and he's willing to run
the /N monitor in the hopes that we can find a solution if we can get a
couple of clean crashes.  However, the last two times we've seen this
problem, Dallas operations has been unable to save the crashes properly.

  Roy is going to be talking to some managers (possibly Swarbrick and
Bill Fisher as well) to try and find out why Dallas has not been very
cooperative with our group in providing what we need, i.e. crash dumps
and running the right monitors on their machines.  I wanted you to be
aware that you may hear something from above about this, then again you
may not hear anything.

  We also saw a similar situation last thursday/friday on system 55 and
Osman told CUPC operations to run /K on system 55 until we can isolate
the problem.  Again, no crashes were saved, so we're still shooting in
the dark -- sigh --

  We've got a meeting scheduled with Bill Soley, Osman and myself for
tomorrow afternoon to discuss what we can find out about FRECOR problems
in the past and how we might go about attacking this problem now.  The
investigation of this problem has sort-of pre-empted some other things
which we discussed doing, (eg. node line list), however I assure you
that I haven't forgotten them...

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

   take note... COMMOD.MAC

      XP SPSNFE,^D4                  yields  SPSNFE =  4   ... ^D4
      XP SPNNFE,^D35                 yields  SPNNFE = 43   ... ^D35
      XP SPTNME,1_SPSNME-1           yields  SPTNME = 17   ... 1_4 - 1

      XP SPTNMM,<<SPTNME>B<SPNNFE>>  yields  SPTNMM = 17   (!) 17B35

    notice the subtle difference between the last 2 lines!!!
    (a single set of "extra" angle-brackets makes a big difference!)

    it's anyone's guess where the 62 came from...  redefining XP as
    XP(SYM,VAL)<SYM==<VAL>>  gives the following macro expansion...

      SPTNMM==<SPTNMEB<SPNNFE>>      yields  SPTNMM = 62
      SPTNMM==<<SPTNME>B<SPNNFE>>    yields  SPTNMM = 17  (!!!)

    This sheds an interesting light on the fact that the crash that
    Osman and I made on 930 on friday had 2 SPT blocks left in frecor
    with a rh value of 62 (!)

...more later...

Subject: SPTNMM = 17

There is light here in the middle of the tunnel... SPTNMM was used
in FILFND at CRESP1+5 to fill in the number of free slots in the SPT
at creation time.  It was setting the field to 62 instead of 17 thus
making it impossible (or nearly impossible) for the SPT to ever be
returned to free core!  It will be interesting to see how many crashes
due to FRECOR / DECUMC, etc that this change fixes!

PS. All /N monitors need to be patched... Osman & I will get to it on
    Monday...   The patch is in FILFND @ CRESP1+5/ HRRI T3,17   sigh!

Will be leaving here very late Sunday the 9th, so my room will need to
have a late arrival verification.  I'll give you my American Express #
if you'd like it to hold the room for me.  If I fly, I will be arriving
after 2am.  If we drive, (and this is what we expect to do), I will
probably not arrive until after 4-6am on the 10th.

  This is due to a previous engagement set for the 9th... I'm going
to be in our skating rink's Christmas show which will be given on
Sunday evening, December 9th...  No problem scheduling after that.

  One way or the other, I expect to be checking out on Friday morning,
December 14th.  Regardless of whether I stay in Anaheim with friends
for a few days or not...

  As far as the type of room, (single, etc.), a single is preferred,
with a regular full-size bed, is fine.  Your message about room for 2
was a little confusing...  Will talk to you later if you need more
information.

Subject: disk cache

    Yes, we already are cached for mapped I/O.  And since SIMIO (old
style Tops-10 I/O) is simulated by the monitor using mapped I/O we are
also cached there.  The % CPU utilization on a heavily used system is
very often 100% which tends to indicate there is no room for improving
system performance with a faster disk.  %core utilization is difficult
to answer.  We always use it all since we keep pages around until we
need the space for something else.  As far as the amount of core used
for active pages that are in user's working sets, it has been a long
time since I measured it, but we used to see between 1 and 1.5 MWords,
regardless of what memory was available.  This does not include about
300 KWords for the monitor.

    So when we take a core system with a heavy load and 1.5 M, and give
it the new ARM-10LS 4 M semiconductor memory, we get about 3 M of cache
space and we get faster memory and it makes a VERY BIG difference.  As
for reading ahead, aside from the blocking factor of 5 blocks per page,
we do not read ahead.  This has been an area of debate.  An outside
cache would not be able to read ahead either, without knowing the files
structure, part of which is in memory (since we don't store files very
contiguously).  If the monitor were to read ahead for the purpose of
loading cache, and the job didn't need it, it would be wasting at least
one (2 if the old page was dirty) disk I/Os and associated compute power
which could actually make the whole system perform worse.  Nobody ever
did a detailed analysis but it has always been felt that the number of
cases where we would benefit from reading ahead would be fewer than
those that did harm.  Also note that this can not improve system
throughput on a heavily loaded system, at best it will only improve
response time, and at worst, both response time and system throughput
will suffer.

    I have a theory that some of the perceived reponse time problem is
due to the Varian base which will be replaced by an Engine in or around
April.

Craig,

    Here is the message you sent about the disk/memory cache.

    ----------------
    Date: Wed, 14 Nov 84 9:54:44 PST
    To: carl,osman,wrs@39
    Subject: disk caching

    I would like to evaluate a suggestion from Telesis memory people that
    we modify TYMCOM-X to use some portion of main memory as a disk cache.
    They are working with a TOPS10 customer to modify TOPS10 to cache the
    disk and experiencing "60%" i/o improvement.

    Isn't TYMCOM-X already effectively cached for mapped i/o? If so,
    is only one page read at a time or are multiple contiguous pages read?
    Is disk caching or some variant applicable to TYMCOM-X?

    A related series of questions is about performance data we need
    before any after any schange in this area.

    What is % cpu utiliation of a TYMCOM_X system.
    WHat is % core utilization of same?
    What is disk i/o rate over time?

    Any comments will be appreciated.

    /cmf
    ----------------

Comments:

    It is important to remember that our disk file-system is spread
    out throughout all of the units within a structure.  The chance
    of having 2 file pages contiguous is reasonably small.

    This was done so that overlapping seeks would provide the best speed
    improvement possible even if only a single file, single user.  Bill
    gave a good explanation of the caching... but to re-iterate we use
    whatever pages are free in memory first, then we start pushing pages
    out based on age.  If a page is needed from disk and it has not been
    removed from physical memory by need of using it for another page,
    then it is simply just "pointed at" and the user receives a "fault"
    but it's read from the "cache of memory pages available" instead of
    disk.

Subject: software list... your referecnce to initia et al

Dennis,
  I don't want to be a "stick in the mud" about sources to things...
but when people left here, they left things in a mess.. I've been trying
to sort out the mess as well as attack the problems that have cropped up
with P034/N.  This is going to take some time.  The sources you are asking
bout for the programs INITIA, COPYRC, CRSHID and DSKCLN are some of the
things which are the messiest!!!

  INITIA requires different versions based on whether it's a 2020 or a KI/KL/F3.
  COPYCR is as transmitted -- correct.
  CRSHID has 3 versions floating around at the moment and my "new" un-trans-
         mitted version is the latest that is out there.
  DSKCLN has a new version, but it's only had preliminary testing... it
         needs a little more testing, then it can be certified.  I'll let
         you know when it's ready...

Talk to craig, but at present it may be best to pick a differetn set of
programs. these are the worst 4 you can pick at present without any knowledge
of what's going on.

I'll talk to you on monday or tuesday the 17th/18th about this before I flay
to the east coast.   Just don't transmit anything new over top of what's
there... or prolems will result.....

up at the office today.  There seems to be something dreadfully *WRONG*

happened to my other week!

  I'm rather depending on that money to cover my first house payment, and
other new bills.  Just because we're switching payroll on 1-Jan-85 should
not affect our checks?  should it?  MDC better not be withholding a weeks
pay... Tymshare was probably already doing that....

Travel Policy for the ISG Blue Sector to bring us more in line with
the needs of our working environment.  A major ingredient in these
changes is the increased responsibility and authority assigned to
management to exercise judgement in approving various travel expenditures.

Weekend Travel Policy is revised as follows:

   a.  Travelers may return home every other weekend.
   b.  Travel home every week may be allowed at the discretion of
       the immediate supervisor (Manager or above) and the Project 
       Manager (if applicable).  The decision to allow travel home every
       weekend should be based on these guidelines:
       
          Travel is paid by the client;
          The cost of travel home is less than or equal to remaining
          at the work site;
          Personal circumstances of the employee;
          Status of the project.

   c.  Every 28 days, the employee may choose to accept roundtrip 
       transportation for a designated individual from home base to

Subject: New monitor o

for D56
Tom Marconi called the other day while 930 was still down and requested
that we send them a monitor cut for 90 frames (as per Roy Roskilly).  I've
generated (OSP)56034N.SAV and F01269.SAV and telecopied the to (M33:56).
Installed patches are BADSPT.PAT and RTCONT.PAT (mask bits 1&2).  /Carl

Subject: JBTINA(J)  JBTPRV(J)[ PVDINA

I think Todd put in the inactivity timeout stuff... but I'd like to
first bounce this off you before I do anything with it.  Right now
there are three ways to set/clear an auto-logout time limit.

1)  setting bit PVDINA in JBTPRV using SETPRV will set the default
    autologout limit of 15 minutes.
    clearing this bit with SETPRV clears any limit set, however set.
2)  SETINA AC,  will set an arbitrary limit up to 17 bits wide or
    zero will clear it.  In the current monitor, this pays no attention
    to PVDINA in JBTPRV and could care less about it. (UUOCON)
3)  SET AUTOLOGOUT n   and  SET NO AUTOLOGOUT
    This too ignores PVDINA completely!  (COMCON)

This seems to me to be a sheer waste of a PRV bit since SETINA and the
command provide the same capabilities...  and checking is easy, 3 fields
in JBTINA(J) available in the gettab tables!

 2 proposals.  --- 1) Remove (FREE) PVDINA from JBTPRV & use -1 in
		      SETINA to set the default value.
	       --- 2) Make COMCON & UUOCON set & clear PVDINA.

In either case, I was thinking that the hardcoded 15 minutes could be
made into a "nice" NSWTBL entry so that operations or someone with the
right license could change it depending upon system load.

================================

Let me know what your thoughts are, so I can document it... I'm trying
to get the YAMM out and I'd like some of these things to be "ACCURATE"!!!!

TWO NEW UNIVERSAL DISK HEAD TESTERS AVAILABLE FROM TYMSHARE

     CUPERTINO, Calif., January 11, 1985 -- Tymshare's Computer
Systems and Support (CSS) division has developed two new universal
disk head testers that provide significant cost savings to users
by substantially reducing down time from incorrect diagnosis, and
by the device's ability to quickly certify the head.

     Developed by the Depot Repair Group in Westlake Village,
Calif., the new products are models 4060P, a portable device for
use in the field, and 4060D, a stationary unit.  Both are
designed for the testing and certification of 100, 200 and 300
megabyte removeable read/write disk heads for most original
equipment manufacturers, including Ampex, Control Data, Cal Comp,
Century Data and Memorex.

     Test data includes reading at highest and lowest write
frequencies, resolution percentage and overwrite in decibels.

     Testing is done on inner and outer tracks with surface
range adjustable.  Test data is available in both CRT display
and hard copy.

                                                                Page  2

     Prices of the testers currently start at $19,500 and
include a CRT, printer and 8-hour training class.

     Tymshare's CSS division provides professional field
maintenance, equipment staging and field engineer training for
the computer industry.  It is part of the Information Systems
Group of McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.

	In 1983 total was 162 and in 1984 it was 290. Here are some
of the reasons which might have contributed to the crash count
increase in 1984.

1. Increase in frequence of "Base Type 7" crashes in /L & /N monitor.
2. Inclusion of system 5780 in Fremont to the crash counts which
   runs TOPS-20 Monitor.
3. Inconsistent entry of crash codes into the MUR Date Base.

1. Increase in frequence of "Base Type 7" crashes in /L & /N monitors.
2. Running /L & /N monitors on more systems in 1984 then in 1983.
3. Inclusion of system 5780 in Fremont to the crash counts which
   runs TOPS-20 Monitor.
4. Inconsistent entry of crash codes into the MUR Date Base.

Cherie hasn't been feeling well the past 2 days and it seems that this
morning I'm beginning to feel bad myself.  She's had a stomach flu, and
I'm showing the same symptoms as she did 3 days ago... so,

  I may not be in at all today (friday) depending on how I feel when
I wake up later.  Please don't call me before 10 or 11 unless it's a
real emergency....  I'll give one of you a call to let you know how I
feel later.

PS.  It's not supposed to be contagious... so, my feeling ill may not
     be related to Cherie's flu at all... sigh.

SUBJECT>   MCDONNELL DOUGLAS REPORTS 1984 EARNINGS


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


ST. LOUIS, Jan. 25, 1985 -- McDonnell Douglas Corporation earned
$325.3 million or $8.10 per share on sales of $9,662.6 million in
1984.  Earnings in 1983 were $274.9 million or $6.91 per share on
sales of $8,111.0 million.

Fourth quarter 1984 earnings were $91.7 million or $2.28 per
share on sales of $2,624.4 million.  In 1983's fourth quarter
earnings were $82.6 million or $2.07 per share on sales of $2,063.2
million.

Hughes Helicopters, Inc., and Computer Sharing Services, Inc.,
which were acquired by McDonnell Douglas early in 1984, are included
in the results for the entire year.  Tymshare, Inc., a computer
services and value-added networking company acquired on March 30, is
included in results for the final three quarters.

Sales in 1984 were higher than 1983's in all product lines
except space systems and missiles, where they remained essentially
unchanged.  The gain was especially strong in combat aircraft and
information systems, but in both cases it resulted primarily from
acquisitions.

Pre-tax earnings in the corporation's combat aircraft line of
                                                                Page  2

business were $483.0 million in 1984, compared with $372.9 million
in 1983, and were achieved despite provision for costs involved in
strengthening the tail sections of previously delivered F/A-18s.
The transport aircraft segment's pre-tax earnings of $56.7 million
compared with a loss of $51.9 million in 1983.  In both combat
aircraft and transport aircraft, the increases resulted largely from
cost reduction initiatives.

The information systems line of business posted a pre-tax loss
of $45.3 million for 1984, compared with a $18.9 million loss the
previous year.  Results for 1984 include a charge of $46.4 million
for amortization resulting from the revaluation of assets purchased
in the corporation's Tymshare and Computer Sharing Services
acquisitions.

Pre-tax earnings in the space systems and missiles segment were
$36.2 million in 1984, compared with $100.7 million in 1983.  Most
of this decline was caused by two previously reported developments:
costs of investigating problems with the Payload Assist Module, and
high proposal costs incurred in bidding on new programs.

Interest costs were higher in 1984 than in 1983, primarily
because of increased borrowings required to complete the acquistions
of Hughes Helicopters, Tymshare and Computer Sharing Services.

Firm backlog on December 31, 1984 was $14,967.8 million,
compared with $10,733.9 million at the end of 1983.  This backlog
excludes orders not yet funded to the corporation, orders being
negotiated as continuations of authorized programs, and commercial
orders subject to contingencies.

Total backlog, including these additional amounts but excluding
options and aircraft being built for short-term lease, was
approximately $22,460.2 million on December 31, 1984, compared with
approximately $17,337.9 million a year earlier.

Employment at the end of 1984 was 88,391 compared with 74,466 at
the end of 1983.

MD-80 program status as of December 31 included 131 firm orders,
6 aircraft being built for lease to airlines by McDonnell Douglas or
other lessors, 170 conditional orders and options and 195 deliveries
for a total of 502 aircraft.

MDC Standards (IRM Standards Section 3.6, dated 7 Sept 84) provides a
list of preferred hardware and software standards that include office
automation and personal computers.  For ISG Blue Sector use, we are
continuing with only the IBM Personal Computer, IBM Personal Computer
XT and IBM Displaywriter for Word Processing as the Desktop Computers
and Word Processing devices approved for automated office systems.

IBM Displaywriter is the standard system for word processing.  User
Support Centers (USC) will provide support for all installed Wang
Systems, but expansion of Wang Systems, which require procurement of
hardware or software, is not authorized.

Configurations have been modified to add additional productivity
software, a letter quality printer and a math coprocessor to the IBM
PC, eliminate the DEC PR0350 configuration, and add asynchronous
communications capability to the Displaywriter.

The User Support Centers are available to provide information and
assistance for configurations and ordering.  USC phone number are:

     St. Louis - 314/233-5116

SUBJECT>   Deployment of New OnTyme Software to Customer Hosts


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As promised, OnTyme is forging ahead in development!  

We will be loading a new version of OnTyme software on customer hosts
per the attached deployment schedule.

Immediately following the code load, a banner will be placed on each
host, asking users to access a public (***) file which will contain
details of the changes in effect.  A copy of that announcement is also
attached for your information.

One of the major benefits of this new code is that it will increase the
number of simultaneous users to 50 per system (currently, customer
hosts have about 42 ports).  And, more importantly, it will enable
us to provide inter-OnTyme connectivity where necessary.

Which brings me to an explanation of how and when we will interconnect
accounts.

As some of you may recall from an earlier memo, in order for OnTyme
systems to communicate with one another, we must update special tables
on each system.  These tables will dictate what other hosts and what
accounts on those hosts, a given OnTyme system may talk to.  And BOTH
sides must be looking back at eachother for the link to be complete.
For example:  in order for an ACS user (832) to talk with a CUST user
(1304), we must

a)  update the lists on 832 to include host number 1304 and account
    CUST

b)  update the lists on 1304 to include host number 832 and account
    ACS

Several weeks after the initial code loads, we will begin turning on
inter-OnTyme on a limited basis - to enable customers to message 
their McDonnell Douglas support personnel.  The first MDC accounts to
be included will be:  ACS, CNS, MDCSS, TYM, FTCC and INTL and other 
                                                                Page  2

affiliate accounts (KTL, TUK, TT, CT).

If you have customers on OnTyme systems, and are not in one of the above
listed accounts, please notify us immediately by sending an ontyme to
ACS.ONTYME.  Tell us who the customer(s) is and what OnTyme host(s) 
are involved.

Shortly after these initial connections are made, we will begin
removing all duplicate TYM and INSD accounts from customer systems.
You will be given one week's notice prior to each cancellation to
enable you to move files and/or advise your customers of your ID change.

That next brings us to how we will handle requests from customers
wishing to connect up with OnTyme customers on different hosts.

Since we do not consider Ontyme to be a 'public system' like the MCIMAILs
or the telephone company, we feel we should have some measures in place
which will ensure the confidentiality of our customers and protect us
from allegations of breaching security.

With this in mind, the following will be required to enable
inter-system messaging between OnTyme customers on different OnTyme hosts.

     A letter, on their company letterhead, must be sent to

                  Applied Communications Systems Co.
                  20705 Valley Green Drive
                  Cupertino, CA  95014
                  ATTN:  Inter-Systems Messaging

     This letter must contain the following information:

                  Their OnTyme host number and
                  account code(s)

                  The name of each customer they
                  wish to be linked to, and
                  that customer's host and
                  account code(s).

     One letter from EACH customer involved in this inter-system
     messaging request must be received before we will 'turn on'
     the capability.  (Turning on the capability takes about an
     hour and can be done as soon as all letters have been
     received.)

NOTE:  OnTyme Support and the Customer Service Center WILL NOT divulge to
any callers the account codes or host locations of any OnTyme customers.
This information must be provided by the customers in question to one
another.


We hope you agree that these measures are in the best interests of your
customers and McDonnell Douglas.

This has been a rather broad overview, and you can expect to receive
'reminders' as we move from  one phase to the next of this project.
Hopefully this information will enable you to give informed
                                                                Page  3

answers to any questions which might be raised by your customers.

We thank you for your continued support and cooperation.

Dear OnTyme User:

This OnTyme system was just upgraded to provide the following enhancements.
We hope you will find these changes beneficial.


     1.  During the network login (Please Log In), you may
         now use a Control-Q (ctrl-Q) to edit a mistyped
         username or password.  (Note - the ctrl-Q must be
         used prior to hitting the carriage return and
         is for use at the Network Level of your login
         process.  The ctrl-Q will not work with your
         ID or KEY.)

     2.  A new OnTyme command (:SCREEN x) enables you to
         have your output automatically freeze (halt) after
         a pre-defined number of lines.

         The command syntax is:

                        :SCREEN x (where x is the number
                                    of lines)
                        
                        :SCREEN OFF

         For example, by issuing the command :SCREEN 20,
         after 20 lines of text had printed on your
         screen (or printer), the screen would freeze -
         thus allowing you to read the screen in a more
         leisurely manner.  Then, by following the
         instructions which would appear just below
         the last line of text, you may continue reading
         one line at a time - or the next group of 20
         lines.

         The command remains in effect until you either
         log off - or issue the command :SCREEN OFF.


                 ***** COMING - SPRING OF 1985 *****

     An online HELP facility - a way for you to ask OnTyme
     for an explanation of any OnTyme command, or system (error)
     message.

     WATCH FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT!

As always, you comments and suggestions are welcome.  So feel free to
contact either your local McDonnell Douglas Support Representative, or
call our new toll-free Customer Service Center at 800-435-8880 for
assistance.

SUBJECT:       ORDERING OF STATIONERY FROM ISG STATIONERY
 
1.   The  ordering  of  supplies from Stationery in MDISG St.  Louis  will  be 
     handled as follows:
 
     a.   MDISG  will provide Stationery items,  MDC and ACF Forms to all Blue 
          Sector  Offices of the former Tymshare organization.
 
     b.   MDISG St.  Louis will provide the Tymshare Gold Sector with only the 
          MDC  and ACF forms.   Any other stationery and supplies required  by 
          the  Gold  Sector  locations  should be  obtained  from  the  normal 
          Tymshare sources until further notice.
 
2.   All  requesters  should  understand that all efforts are  being  made  to 
     acquire  sufficient supplies to meet their needs.   Most of our  supplies 
     are  obtained  via  the  MCAIR  organization  and  the  quantities  being 
     requested  at  the  present  time are exceeding  planned  for  levels  of 
     support.

The ordering of supplies from Stationery in MDISG St. Louis will be
handled as follows:

     -- MDISG will provide Stationery items, MDC and ACF Forms to all 
        Blue Sector offices of the former Tymshare organization.

     -- MDISG St. Louis will provide the Tymshare Gold Sector with only
        the MDC and ACF forms.  Any other stationery and supplies
        required by the Gold Sector locations should be obtained from
        the normal Tymshare sources until further notice.

Requesters should understand that all efforts are being made to
acquire sufficient supplies to meet their needs.  Most of our supplies
are obtained via the MCAIR organization and the quantities being
requested are exceeding planned levels of support.

RAVE REVIEWS are STILL POURING in on the premiere ACS BASIC PRODUCT SCHOOL, 
held February 4-8 at the Santa Clara Marriott.

HIGHLIGHTS of the one-week course included:  PRESENTATIONS on each of the
"pieces" of an ACS Integrated Application;  An excercise where attendees 
"Put It All Together" by developing and presenting their own ACS integrated
solution;  A HEATED TRIVIAL PURSUIT CONTEST - testing attendees on their more
"trivial" knowledge of ACS;  A Field Trip to  ACS Headquarters - where
participants "broke bread" with members of the entire ACS organization; 
AND LOTS of in-depth training on ALL aspects of ACS.

The course is planned for a REPEAT performance March 18-22, and is also
tentatively planned for sometime in mid-April.  The March class is ALREADY
full - although enrollments will continue to be accepted on a first-come first-
serve basis to fill any last-minute cancellations.

For prerequisite and enrollment information, see public file *** BPS.OVERVIEW 
or CONTACT Sarah Chamlee Kinkle, Course Development (ACS.S/CHAMLEE or X 6469),
or Madeleine Ayer, Training Support Specialist (ACS.TRAINMAIL or X 6184).

*****A very SPECIAL CONGRATULATIONS (and THANK YOU) to Sarah and Madeleine,
by the way, for a Beautifully organized school.  And, THANK YOU to all of the
ACS Folks who participated...your well-spent energies were APPRECIATED!!*****

Get it while its HOT!!!  The New HOTLINE NUMBER for the CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTER
(CSC) is...got a pencil?...

                           800-435-8880
          Operating Hours: Mon-Fri, 8-5 (Pacific Std. Time)

                                or
                            CSC.HOTLINE

The Customer Service Center's INITIAL ROLE will be as a first line of
SUPPORT for ONTYME CUSTOMERS.  They will provide immediate response to a
customer's CRY FOR HELP...and will provide useful feedback to the
particular sales representative or applications consultant regarding
that customer's SUPPORT NEEDS.




In addition to OnTyme Customer Support (and Internal Support) the
HOTLINE will also act as a REFERRAL point for calls regarding other
ACS products, and in the future, the CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTER hopes to
be able to actually SUPPORT all of ACS' products.

The HOTLINE is for CUSTOMERS only, but sales representatives and applications
consultants NEED NOT FEAR...ACS continues to offer a variety of support 
mechanisms for YOU!!  For an up-to-date listing of Product Support Contacts 
within ACS, check the ACS PRODUCT SUPPORT REFERENCE GUIDE on System 49!
Just type " SUPPORT " at the CMS prompt.  This on-line Information Guide was
UPDATED THIS MONTH, so it's time to run off a copy for your VERY own!

As the "MOST PROLIFIC TRIVIAL PURSUER" in ACS (an award achieved by creating
the BEST trivial pursuit questions for use in a recently held Basic Product
School contest), PAM FARRELL wins the highly coveted and VERY prestigious
HONOR of being FEATURED ...up close and personal... in this month's
ACS NEWSFLASH!

Pam recently joined the MPM Support Group to take over the Support
responsibilities for EXPRESS and our mainframe-based Graphics products.
She is a self-avowed EXPRESS GURU, and believes that the product can do
practically anything...except maybe Ski!

But that's where Pam comes in.  An avid skier (she lives in Denver, and skies
at Vail...), Pam extends an open invitation to any of her fellow ACS'rs who
may make it to Denver - to JOIN her for a "run down the back bowls of Vail."
When not on the slopes, Pam is sometimes 37,000 feet above sea level - commuting
between Denver and Cupertino.  Such a tiring commute can have its
advantages - it enables her to visit her nearby sister and nephew on
occasion; BUT it also means that her 3 FELINE FRIENDS (Max, Miles and Leo)
at home have to "wing it" ("paw it?") on their own.

WHY did Pam know so much TRIVIAL TRIVIA about MDC and ACS?  Well, she was
born and bred in St. Louis...and comes to ACS from MDCSS...and has worked
for Tymshare for almost 3 years.

WHAT is the most trivial thing ABOUT PAM?  She wouldn't tell me, but YOU
can try to find out by OnTyming ACS.EXPRESS !

I've prepared a complete transmittal build file for CRSHID including
an FDM file with all the appropriate source files, the .SAV file and
the .LOG file showing the result of the build.  The FDM file may be
archived 'as is' and software distribution may feel free to dump all
the files to disk and re-build it if they please.

This new version has already been moved around to all the normal hosts.
(In particular: 22,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,54,55

Subject: Stupid ACTSER bug

I doubt very much if this bug is ever being exercised, but it can't
hurt to patch it out.  In ACTSER, we check to see if the record type
is .ge. 40 and if so, we do a JRST @SPCACT-40(type) where the SPCACT
table consists of JRST's and STOPCD's.

Why this is interesting is that STOPCD produces JSR SYSCRS and the
JRST @SPCACT(x) will simply JRST to SYSCRS which is definately a
no-no causing an illins trap immediately!!!

Note: OSMAN, please install this patch to teh new monitor just built
      for system 56.  See (OSP)SPCACT.PAT

Hmmmmm,
   Interesting.  We got a garbage PC from the interval timer interrupt
and crashed.  Looking at the crash briefly, IRPPDP[ 57  IRP620[ 63
PC from interrupt[ 116224,,14417  $8o; 47,45,1,220,360
Now, see IRING+62[ 116224,,14417    ... Hmmmm ...  It appears that the
very last piece of data written by the base, (?before updating IRP620)
is the same as the garbage PC stored by the JSR PAT+3.  I think this is
the correlation that we were specifically looking for. !!!!

Hello,
  I've been staying with Carl since last Thursday.  It seems that because
of me, he's been in bed all week end and is still too sick to come into
the office.  He's been trying to get rid of me, but I keep hanging on.  He
will try to get rid of me by tomorrow so that he can come in for the weekly
meeting.
  Right now, his head is all stuffed up and his eyes are buring a little
so I'm keeping him in bed.  Send him mail if you want something & he'll try
to get back to you.

Bye.

This morning's crash on C39 was my fault.  I was looking at the IRPPDP
location and as my cursor went off the screen instead of .[ .[ .[
we ended up with .[ .[ .<return>  thereby depositing the wrong value
into IRPPDP (or was it IRP620?), anyway I was [write enabled] and the
system went down, I'll bet with an input ring processing timeout crash.

the telecommunications industry.  This task group will focus on the
strategy for ISG's products and services to the companies that are
providers of telecommunications products and services.

Paul Scholten will serve as Project Director.  Recently Paul
successfully completed his assignment as Project Director for the
Discrete Manufacturing Industry Strategy Task Group.  The
recommendations of this group are currently under review by the ISG
Executive Board pending completion of the other strategic task groups.

The newly appointed task group is made up of six other highly qualified
individuals who bring a broad spectrum of talents and experience to this
team.  In addition to Paul, they are:

     Don Barcus      - ISG - Discrete Manufacturing Strategy Team
     Jerry Chervitz  - McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry
                       Systems Company (Originally from Tymshare)

All of these individuals have set aside important responsibilities to
contribute their full-time efforts to the critical task of charting our
future in this industry.  We appreciate their participation and
confidently anticipate the results of their work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Effective 4 March 1985, the complete cost for all meals for clients,
guests and their hosts in Guest Dining will be charged to the 
department making the reservation.  This will make the experience
less institutional by eliminating the need to ask the guest to check
a box and have an employee sign for the meal.  Internal meal events
will now be treated the same as business meals taken at a local
restaurant.

Each place setting will have the buffet menu, printed on a 
single-sided card, for information only.  The waitress will
take beverage and dessert orders.

If there are any questions on how this will be administered, please
call Al Schikore at (314) 232-2745 or Shirley Meyer at
(314) 233-5196.

The  Valley  Forge Data Center will be closing during  the  third 
quarter  of  1985.   Planning is currently underway to  move  all 
users off of the host computers in this center.
 
Mr.  Brett  Fairchild  has been assigned as  Project  Manager  to 
assure that the center is closed in a smooth and timely manner.
 
Effective immediately, Ms. Roberta (Robbie) Berosh will take over 
as  acting  manager of the data center.   Robbie has been  a  key 
person at this center for 10 years and we can be assured she will 
keep it running efficiently until the last user is moved out.
 
Please  contact either Brett or Robbie if you have  any  concerns 
about  customers being serviced by this center or if you have job 
openings for any of the talented personnel in Valley Forge.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


MDC policy regarding spouse travel is as follows:  "Any married
salaried employee whose duties require frequent trips for MDC may
be accompanied by spouse, at MDC expense, on a business trip when the
presence of the spouse is considered to be appropriate to the 
business purpose of the trip."  The approval presently required is
a component head with no delegations allowed.

A recent corporatewide audit of this subject revealed that it is
working effectively; however, there is some confusion within several
MDC components over who is the appropriate approval authority.

To clarify this within ISG, John McDonnell has delegated approval
authority for spouse travel to R. A. Fischer (Blue Sector) and
G. E. Liebl (Gold Sector).  No further delegations are authorized
at this time.

SUBJECT>   ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Effective Feb. 19, 1985, I am establishing a new organization called Advanced
Products Development, combining the Computer Technology Group originating
in Tymshare and the GEMSTONE Group from Microdata.  Historically, both
of these organizations have been commissioned with the responsibility
of investigating and developing state-of-the-art operating systems, office
automation capabilities, and fourth-generation tools.

The individual responsible for this new organization will be Mr. Frank
J. Reinhart, who will have the title Vice President, Advanced Products
Development.  Frank has functioned over the past year as a Vice President
of Microdata and has worked with me on ISG projects involving both
Tymshare and Microdata activities.  Prior to this special assignment,
Mr. Reinhart was Vice President, U.S. Engineering, for Microdata
Corporation.

Mr. Laszlo L. Rakoczi, Group Vice President, Computer Technology Group,
has resigned that role and will function as a consultant to ISG on 
special assignments and projects designated by me.  I would like to
acknowledge the contributions Laz has made to Tymshare over the years
and, subsequently, to ISG.  I look forward to taking maximum advantage
of Laz's unique experience and capability in this new role.

During the transitional phase integrating GEMSTONE and Computer
Technology, Frank Reinhart will be accountable to Paul W. Wiedenmann
                                                                Page  2

with regard to the GEMSTONE project and to me for Computer Technology
activities.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these 
organizational changes.  Also, please join me in wishing both Frank
and Laz the best of luck in their new assignments.

1mar85 crash onsystem 56 looks like ch1/ 206441,,52077 could be a word
from the base.  What do you think?

Subject: Recent crashes on 33,56,39

Craig,
  Yes!  The crashes mentioned above ARE of the type that we've been
discussing.  On 33 & 39 we have one crash each at the PC format check
patch address, and CRA001 on system 56 is indeed another crash with
"base" type data in the PC word.

  On 33 & 39 I've located data in the IRING which matches the bad PC,
however it is not conclusive at this time, since on 33 the data appeared
in dozens of locations, and on 39 it appeared at IRING+161/163? while
both IRP620 & IRPPDP said 14.

  However, it is conclusive that the PC address is being clobberred by
data from somewhere (even if we can't assume that it's the base).

I will be out of the office either later tonight or sometime early
next week, to have my elbow looked at.  I fell on it last weekend and
it appears to have some sort of "water-on-the-elbow" problem which is
bothering me and needs attention.  I'll give you more details as necessary.

Subject: F3 Boots & CRASH.SAV

Thanks to Osman and Carl, we've found BOOTS.SAV for the F3 and demonstrated
that it works properly on 930.  (SYS)CRASH.SAV is also "fixed" now, so we
are able to save crashes on 930 as well.  I tested this by depositing 'CARL'
in 30 from home today, and it worked fine!  (SYS)CRA001.SAV was saved just
a short while ago.

Subject: F3 boots & CRASH.SAV on 897

We found the correct BOOTS.SAV to write boots out to the F3s, so I
made a point in re-writing it on system 897 and then I expanded the
(SYS)CRASH.SAV file to the correct size (512 pages).

The next crash should be automatically saved and the system should
re-boot itself without operator intervention.  We should probably
test this sometime to make sure it's all setup, but if either of you
happen to notice that 897 gets reloaded and the OPER didn't do it,
please let me know.

I've been tinkering around with the INFO tree, so if you notice that
something "went away" feel free to comment.  It may have, or it may
have just "moved away".

Oh yes, while I was wandering, I ran across (MONDOC)P33SEG.INF which
is the info node SEGMENTS.  Coming from TOPS-10, it gives a "crystal-
clear" description about differences in our paging vs. the old way
with commentary on both segment control and some i-o.  Take a look if
you haven't already.

Subject: Did you know...

  I was "browsing" through files in (MONDOC) and I found a few files
  chock full of enlightening monitor information.

  Did you know that we once ran monitor N016 on C33 in cupertino?
  And that N016 begat N017 ... N027
  And then we went to P001, P002, ... P011, P011/A, ... P034/A, P034/N ?

  For 20 points and a lunch at Kirks:

    What was the reason why we incremented the "N" as in N027 to "P"
    as in P001?

I'll probably work from home, if at all today (Monday).  I've been sick all
weekend, in bed all day Sunday, so I'm not sure I'll be in any shape to work.
I'll let you know in the morning.

I also have a doctor's appt. at 3:00 in Mountain View, so if I come in, it
will be early & I'll be leaving by 2:00 ish.  See you all later.

[Osman, I'll talk to you about the COMCON bug on the phone if I don't come
 in, so I (we) can get crackin' on solving this thing once and for all.]

Subject: Disk space

The extra disk space, obviously came from someone cleaning out
directory (UN1) accounting files.

** I didn't delete them **
And, so sorry, I'd like whomever did delete them to restore them!!!

I still have some accounting to check against those files, and that is
our cache of pages to delete when we are ready to transmit a new monitor
version.  Such as it is....

Note: The SYSTEM MESSAGE was put up last week when we were down below 800
      pages.  With some effort, oit was brought back up to over 10,000.
      So, I'd appreciate it if we could have Mike (the co-op) restore all
      of directory (UN1) from the last all-files tape.   THANK YOU.

transportation of our customer loads to other centers as smooth and

as uncomplicated as possible.

SUBJECT>   SPLITTING THE 'TYM' ONTYME ACCOUNT


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


To improve OnTyme's availability and responsiveness to users in the
'TYM' OnTyme account, it has become necessary to bring up another
OnTyme system and spin off two groups of users into new accounts.
They are:

   TYMOPS     Tymnet Operatons - personnel reporting thru Bob Tomasi
   TYMNFE     Tymnet Field Engineering - personnel reporting thru Curt Miller

These new IDs are valid now - so you should address all correspondene
as appropriate to these IDs.

For a complete listing of personnel in these two new accounts, and
those who remain in the TYM account, read:

           *** DIRECT.TYM
           *** DIRECT.TYMNFE
           *** DIRECT.TYMOPS

Please reflect these changes in any distribution lists you may be using.
Those now valid in TYMOPS and TYMNFE will be having their TYM ids
deleted on March 22.

Also, due to the chargeback system now in place for computer resources,
we will begin deleting all TYM ids belonging to persons in organizations
which have their own OnTyme accounts.  For example, FIN, INTL, ACS,
PMTS, etc.

Since inter-OnTyme allows us to communicate across systems, there is no
justification for people outside of Tymnet to have TYM ids any more.

If you are not valid in your own division (or department's) OnTyme account
or know of anyone, please be sure to get (them) validated immediately
in the proper account.

We will be notifying 'non-Tymnet' 'TYM' users later in the month
as to when these IDs will be cancelled.

For now, however, remember to message Tymnt Operations and Field
Engineering personnel at their NEW IDs.

Thank you.

ANNOUNCEMENT!!!
Integrated Systems Marketing is presently developing an "ACS Seminar" for
presentation to FORTUNE-1000 MIS/Telecommunications Management Audiences.

The Seminar's central theme is that most large companies today have heavy
information movement problems (whether it be collecting the information,
doing some analysis on it, or disseminating the information in a time-critical
fashion); and that this DEMAND for IMPROVED DATA COMMUNICATION is growing
faster every day.  So, what is McDonnell Douglas' answer to this DEMAND?

McDonnell Douglas' answer is APPLIED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS COMPANY (ACS)!
The Movement of low to moderate volumes of high value information within the
framework of a distributed application is one of ACS' greatest strengths.  We
have the hardware, software, network and the people necessary to assist the
MIS manager in delivering these systems.

The Seminar will consist of several segments: A Guest Speaker will discuss
actual experienced Distributed Information problems, and will overview
how ACS helped solve those problems.  Members of various ACS Support groups
will evolve this single ACS solution into several other integrated application
solution examples.  And, finally, an on-line demonstration will be used
to help incorporate a variety of ACS Products/Technologies.

WATCH for further information in upcoming ACS NEWSFLASH editions!!!

Subject: Base type 7 (KL), ILLINS (KI)

I don't know how much you were told before you left for Maynard, but
it has been determined exactly as we thought, that the base type 7
crashes and the illins+2 crashes are caused by the same series of events.

In both crash types, the frame pointed to in c<JOB> has "just" received a
LOGIN request message from the base.  In each case c<IRPPDP> points just
past the LOGIN message in the IRING for the port assigned to frame c<JOB>.

The reason reason we're seeing the bad-PC is because the CURUPT and the
UPT page are being set to 0, then some memory reference fails, it takes
the page-fail vector [location 501] using the current UPT page 0, i.e.
it fetches the PC word from physical location 501, which just happens to
be IRING+161, thus EUREKA! the PC looks like a base word.  I've checked
and the only cases where this is not apparently true is where the base
has already overwritten location 500/501 with new data.

Anyway, in most cases, this new PC attempts to do something, and most of
the cases I've researched, the PC is in another section, and either ERASTS
or SAVERA has reflected similar information.

I'm still looking, but I have NOT YET found where anything happens with
the new frame, thus causing all of this stuff.  On the KI, if you remember
I followed it all the way to job termination.  On the KL, I've followed
it through to where the scheduler gets involved, but have not seen where
the particular frame is setup...

(m33:930)TIMOUT.LOG is a "pretty'd up" log of some of the stuff I've been
looking at.  You and Joe can look over some of it and let me know when I
come in today, what else we can look for.  Finding the right place in the
sources may sound easier, but if we can't trace it to pinpoint it to the
same place in the source by the register and memory contents, we are still
guessing.

PS. I should be in for today's meeting.  Staying in bed all day yesterday
    and today seems to have done me a world of good.

Subject: Base type 7, aka KAF

More discourse on our base type 7 (KL), illins+2 (KI) crashes,
also known as (aka) KAF or the 10-year bug [at DEC].

I think our KAF is "not" the same as DEC's bug, although I have made
no real conclusions.  Tracing the code, I've found more info, but not
the cause or the cure....

  Darren's new code in COMCON et al is straightforward & careful.  If
  the problem is "newly created" there, I'd doubt it.  Frame creation
  from the forced-login follows along just fine, including context-page
  generation, rescheduling again ... until LOGINN is in core & running.
  [The code, that is... not the frame in our crashes... that's our mystery]

  Somehow, we have a frame, with no context pages, a command pending,
  jbtnam/"LOGINN"  DDB & LDB assigned ok, jbtsts/JNA only, presumably
  in the RUNQ, [STOPQ=32, and jbtq(j)/-34,,-34  or -33,,-33 in most
  cases] and jbtctx/0 jbtupm/0.

  My suspicions are that in killing a previous frame, something didn't go
  completely away yet, due to rescheduling, or something... and that we
  should try to fix it as the previous frame is going away.

I've NOT been in the office the past few afternoons simply trying to

Subject: "CPU" program requires PERF. uuo

To get the cache hit ratio, the program issues a PERF. uuo (CALLI 162)
to enable the performance meters in the KL hardware.  The monitor translates
this to do a WRPAE instruction (BLKO TIM,=702100,,0) which tells the
KL to count the number of cache misses.  This number is divided by the
MBOX count to get the cache miss ratio.

I believe that this feature needs a change to the Monitor sources, and
is too complex to be done as a DDT patch.

Subject: WRPAE and RDPERF

We're discussing performance gathering... I'm not sure how complicated
a patch for doing either the WRPAE or RDPERF might be, but I don't
think that it would be all that difficult.  It looks pretty simple.
I'm not sure about where we have the MBOX count (except on an individual
user by user basis for accounting) but it should be easy enouh to
gather it together for a ratio.

We should discuss this more on Tuesday, at the 1:00 meeting.  /Carl

Purpose:  To provide network connection for a new Tymcom-X 2020 host.

Date needed completion:  Week of April 15, 1985.

Customer contact:  Dennis Coffey.  Ontyme:  TXS.D/COFFEY
                   phone: (415)794-2588, or (from VG) 116, X2588.

Location:  McDonnell-Douglas Field Service Co. office,
           39100 Liberty St., Fremont CA 94538
           Host location is "Training Lab" computer room--same room as
           network nodes 3146 (Engine) and 3143 (Mini-Engine).

Customer:  McDonnell-Douglas Field Service Co.; formerly Tymshare Computer
           Systems and Support Div.

Customer Supplied Equipment:
          1.)  Host.
          2.)  Micro-TymBase (Tymnet II type), and its node-code.
          3.)  Cabling between Micro-TymBase and Host.
          4.)  Cabling between network node and Micro-TymBase (cable is
               sync. type, compatible with Tymnet T-201 protocol, for 
               short distance transmission.  RS232-C connector will be
               of gender requested by Tymnet.  Length will be about 75 ft.
               (This length has proven successful without long-distance
               drivers for 2 similar network connections at this site.)

Needed from Tymnet:  
          1.)  2-digit host number for the host (a "Tymshare" Tymcom-X 2020).
          2.)  A terminal-host number for this host (to build aux. circuits).
          3.)  A Tymnet-II node number for the Micro-TymBase node.
          4.)  Node-code changes for the network node (either 3143 or 3146
               to which the Micro-TymBase will be a neighbor).
          5.)  A visit by an FE to make the connections.
          6.)  A cross-over, with one end with the proper gender to connect
               to the existing network node, and the other end of the most
               available gender.  When this gender is determined, please 
               notify the customer contact so the appropriate gender RS232-C
               connector can be used in the customer supplied cable.
          7.)  Anything I've forgotten.

Subject: Deleted files!!!!!

Ok everyone:
   *** We are low on disk space on 930 ***

  This means police your own directories and clean up things which don't need
to reside on system 930.  This does NOT mean to delete files which do NOT
belong to you.

  Someone has been deleting files from system directories & it is causing
havoc, and wasting my valuable time figuring out what was deleted (by whom)
and having it replaced.  Directories which we know have had files deleted
include (SYS), (UN1), (GAMES), (MAIL) and a couple of others.  If another
directory gets cleared by an un-authorized person, then this system will 
become a restricted system.  All usernames not personally known to me will
be removed.  License will be reduced or removed for any account which does
not show a definate need for said license.

I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Bernard "Bernie"
Hathaway to the position of Vice President, Productivity for the
Gold Sector of the Information Systems Group.  In this position,
Bernie will report directly to me and will be responsible for
the introduction of formal productivity and performance improvement
programs throughout the Gold Sector as well as coordination with
McDonnell Doulgas Corporate Productivity Council.

Bernie's three years of experience as Microdata/McDonnell Douglas
Computer Systems Company's Senior Vice President of Manufacturing
coupled with his two years of service on the Corporate Productivity
Council have prepared him well for this assignment.  We have few
higher priorities than productivity improvement and the talent and
experience that Bernie will provide is necessary support for this
effort.

Please join me in congratulating Bernie on his new assignment
and providing your support to him as we more actively strive to
improve our productivity posture.

My back muscle has loosened up enough & seems to have itself back under
control, (at least no major pain at the moment).  Rest & medication seems
to have done it's job.

Thus, I expect to be in for a short while Thursday.  I need to stop over
building C to talk to the tape librarian there, and have an appointment
at the county health office around 4ish in San Jose, so I expect to
spend my afternoon in Cupertino.

I will be at home otherwise and will be available by phone (408) 945-4314
or by system mail.  TUMS has been fixed.

but probably no at the moment] I would like to get my paycheck for the

it deposited prior to my going on vacation.

  I don't know what kind of administrative OK's this needs, but I'm sure

Well, it appears that I'll be working at home again today.  My car went
to the shop last night so that they could have it ready by noon... and
they didn't even start to look at it till noon, so now it's promised by
five.  I will try and stop by for awhile when my car is ready.

I'm available for consultation via mail... or call me if there's something
more urgent.  I'll be on and off most of the afternoon.  /Carl

  From: MOSSERJ, APR 9, 1985   14:31
  Carl,
  Did Craig give you that software change request from Dan Wedge
  pertaining to f40 link ?? If so, Any status?
  jon
...
Jon,
  I don't recall receiving any requests from Craig.  Dennis mentioned
something to me about Fortran-10 & Link (I think), but I'm pretty sure
that this is the first I heard about F40 & Link.  My understanding is
that the 3rd phase of the F40 compilation is completed by special codes
in LOADER, and I do not know if LINK-10 handles that properly.  That is
the main reason why LINK-10 has not ever been considered as an official
replacement for LOADER.
  This entire issue needs further examination, and I will need some
clarification of what Dan Wedge is requesting and what he really needs.

Subject: recent NEW monitors

/N08	- added stopcd at CIP7+3 to crash if JBTUMP(J) is effectively 0.
	- moved input ring & other buffers out of page 0, setup UPT-like
	  trap vectors in page zero to aid in trapping bad UPT faults.

The patch file ITMINT.PAT is no longer necessary.  At least we know that
monitors after /N08 do not need to be patched.  The error is caught at
CLOCK1:CIP7+3 if we get there with a job with no context pages assigned.
We have recorded a crash on C39 at CIP7+3 since /N08 was installed.

/N09	- deleted MAPONC(DUM,1) macro which kept a dummy per-process
	  page around because of a suspected bug, possibly fixed in
	  release /L31.

/N10	- added check in FRMASN to make sure job to be assigned is in
	  the NUL queue, and if not to log it BADQUE,BADQUE+1
	- removed unneeded use of a register to access a pointer.

This change should fix the assumed problem caused by a frame being
killed scheduled to go into the NUL queue but not yet there, getting
placed back in the RUN queue because SCNSER tried to assign another
tty to this frame number in the same clock tick.  All free frames
must now come from the NUL queue.

Hi There..

Systems C36,C897,C930 and F58 are running /N10 monitor.
Systems C33, C39, C57 will be coming up with /N10 on next bring up.
System  D56 is still down, will take care of it when it comes up.

Bill,
  Systems C36, C897 are currently running /N10.  Systems C39, C57 will
be coming up on /N10 at the next scheduled reload.  57 is a KI and we
will get a chance to see if the ILLINS+2 crashes there are caught by
the same stopcd (if any at all*).

* /N10:  It seems that after our discussion, the last item we talked
about for checking if the job is in the NULQ started me thinking.  At
first I was going to check if the current PJBSTS field was the NULQ.
Well, that's not true in the case where PJBSTS == NULQ but JRQ is on!!!
So, we looked further... DECHJB which checks if a job going away and if
it needs to DECrement the HighJB variable checks JNA+CMWB+JRQ.  It seems
that FRMASN only checked JNA+CMWB.  SO... in addition to checking to see
if the frame is in the NULQ (JBTSTS==0; never used yet | PJBSTS==NULQ),
when I check JNA+CMWB I'm also checking JRQ.

  This is interesting in as much as if the job was in queue X and was
supposed to be put into the NULQ the next scheduler call (JRQ is set)
then someone comes along sees JNA off, doesn't check JRQ, re-assigns the
frame number, re-queues it for another queue, then it never goes into
the NULQ !!!  And I suspect something else thinks it can go directly in
the run queue and >BANG< we have our problem...

  It seems reasonable that this could happen, although following the code
it wasn't clear that this COULD happen at all.  Anyway, IF JRQ is set,
I think we shouldn't care what queue it's in or going into... since the
scheduler is expecting to have to do something to it, we shouldn't try
to assign it.. so we should skip it.  This being the case... we should
have solved the problem with this coding change.

  Cross your fingers... 'cause if it's fixed, we can then get on to some
other projects, like STOPCDs on the CTY, EXE files, etc...

                         ************************
 
 
    DSC is anouncing a Product CHANGE to an already existing Product--The
    Model 130 Portable KSR Teleprinter. 
 
    Until now, the Model 130 has been available as a standard Portable KSR
    Terminal with several options. It is now being made available in four
    configurations which include various combinations of options. So when
    ordering Portable KSR Printers, be sure and use the new Model Numbers. 
 
    Product Position 
 
    The Model 130 is a product whose time has definitely come. No matter
    what your customer or prospect is selling, they can now carry the
    solution with them. Its small (11"x8"x2") size enables "portability
    in a brief case." Remote computer access becomes as easy as using a
    telephone. 
 
    Applications 
 
    Typical applications for the Model 130 teleprinter include timesharing,
    data base access, and electronic mail and messages. Accessing real
    estate multiple listisngs or insurance quotes and coverages are just two
    applications for which the model 130 proves ideal. 
 
    Benefits and Key Selling Points 
 
    * It has all the functions needed for doing business in or out of the
    office. 
 
    * Weighing only 5.9 pounds, it's easy to carry, and the price is easy on
    your pocketbook. 
     
    * The direct connect feature gets your computer online for fast
    answers. 
 
    * The Model 130's built-in battery pack and acoustic coupler enable you
    to have phone booth access to your computer.

46, 49, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 127, and 146 will be relocated to system  
C34.  Tymnet usernames will be relocated to system D54. Files belonging    
to Dallas Operations, RPM, Operations Maintenance, and Software support    
will not be transferred during this move.  If there are any files that
need to be saved, please have them transferred by someone within the  
group.

SUBJECT:       NETWORK SECURITY POLICY
 
--------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
The security and integrity of our corporate information and 
our customers' information is vital to our business thus the    
attached policy on Network Security was developed to guide us.
 
We now have a Data Security function and a Security Policy
Committee  consisting  of:   Clint  DeGabrielle,  Al  Fenn,  
Rick Forberg, Curt Miller, Bob Tomasi, and Wayne Bartlett as
chairman.    This   committee   developed  this  policy  for 
my endorsement.  I strongly support it and the need for 
attention and vigilance in insuring that it is implemented.  
We  will be following this policy with appropriate procedure  
and auditing activities.  In particular the Personnel Security
Agreement for employees will be forthcoming in the near 
future.  There is much you can do at department level to insure
compliance with the policy.
 
Remember, safeguarding corporate assets is part of everyone's
job.
 
Questions about this policy should be directed to Wayne Bartlett,
Director, Data Security, at Orchard Parkway, San Jose.

      Data security and network integrity are vital to our 
      business and the business of our customers.  To that end
      we will vigoriously track down violations and support
      prosecutions within the limits of the law.
 
      A data security and integrity function will be maintained
      to foster the development of tools and techniques, and
      to audit, investigate, and evaluate network integrity.
      This function will also support customers in their efforts
      to track, evaluate, and prosecute violations of their data
      security.
 
      Use of passwords provides a key basis for protection of
      information and data within the network.  The following
      policy relates to their use:
 
          1.   USE OF PASSWORDS IS MANDATORY FOR EMPLOYEES
 
          2.   THEY MUST NOT BE DISPLAYED, DOCUMENTED OR
               COMMUNICATED TO OTHERS
 
          3.   A PASSWORD MUST CONSIST OF A MINIMUM OF SEVEN
               CHARACTERS WITH ONE EMBEDDED NON-ALPHA
               CHARACTER
 
 
          
 
     
          4.   INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT
               OR WHO HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL RESOURCES OR FILES
               ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS EVERY 30 DAYS
               OR LESS.  OTHERS ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS
               EVERY 90 DAYS OR  LESS

          5.   EVERYONE MUST REPORT ANY SUSPECTED MISUSE PROMPTLY
               TO THE DATA SECURITY FUNCTION
 
      We will actively promote and support all legislative issues
      and all standards activities that we judge to improve or
      enhance the security, integrity, and protection of
      information.
 
      Appropriate  labels and access entry messages will be  used 
      to inform legitimate users and trespassers of the confiden-
      tiality and privacy of information.
 
      A.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES:
 
      We are responsible to protect and preserve all customers'
      data residing on our system with the same safeguards as
      for our own.
 
      Customers are required to use network security features 
      and controls in order to provide security of their own
      information.  We are responsible to inform and educate
      them in the use of these features and controls.  Customers
      are urged to use passwords in a manner similar to our
      requirement for our employees.  The use of passwords is
      a prerequisite  to our support of investigations of
      security problems.
 
      We will support customers in their efforts to investigate
      and track down suspected problems provided that:
 
               1.  They are using the available features and
                   controls
               2.  They are committed to prosecute violators 
 
      Operator  privilege licenses will  not  be  granted  to
      customers.
     
 
 
      C.  PERSONNEL
 
      A security agreement will be reviewed and signed by each
      employee and filed with his/her personnel file.  The agree-
      ment will cover the importance of data security and the
      procedures required to safeguard information.
 
      Computer access and privileges for each employee will be
      limited to those necessary for his/her job function.
 
      Maintaining the security of corporate assets is a part of
      everyone's responsibility, and execution of that 
      responsibility will be considered part of everyone's job
      performance.

Subject: F3XNXX Synch with uNode

Well guys, it worked all along... having the system go through the
synch code at clock level lets INITIA get started and DSKCLN and all
that other stuff.  I still haven't added code to "guess" when the
base goes away, but that's the next step.

  What was wrong, and why it didn't come up was in editing SCNSER.MAC
one of the instructions XCT TYPTRN(P1) got clobbered to XCT TYPTRN(P)
i.e. the "1" got erased, and so SCNSER would loop forever as soon as
it finished synchronizing with the micro-base, executing some weird
instruction off in never-never land, always the same, and thus never
incrementing P1 or P4 to look at the next IRING location...

  Anyway, at the moment we're running that code... I'll probably put
some kind of timer or clock that sets a flag whenever so many ticks
have passed and the base hasn't changed the ORP620 pointer after the
host has completely filled it... i.e. output ring processing time-out.
This needs a little thought and a little research before the final
implementation.  Also, I'll need to test the new SCNSER on a KI/KL/KS.

SUBJECT>   Operating System Software Upgrades for French Tymcom-X Hosts


-----------------------------------------------------------------------



     We are currently involved upgrading and making current various

programs related to or part of the TYMCOM-X operating system.  These

changes are being implemented in groups/packages of related programs,

eg.: those determining a session in the system (LOGINN, GFD); setting

master license (SETOP, OPPS); processing commands to the operating 

system (LISTER, LOADER, RPG); etc.

     Please make certain these changes are acceptable to the customer,

and notify us of their acceptance.  We strongly recommend/request

that you 'sell' the upgrades to the customer (if necessary):  these

newer versions will be consistent with the Tymshare PDP-10's, and

earlier versions will not remain supported.

     The following documents the proposed upgrade(s) of the operating

system software which we would like to install on the CEGI systems

and system 90.  

                                                                Page  2

  



Program Name:  SETOP.SAV

Current Version:  14

New Version:  20



Comments: New version provides greater security.  This version has been 

on one system for 18 months.

     Note that passwords must conform to new standards.

     This is only for system 90.

Changes between versions:

Version 20 of SETOP enforces the new TYMNET password standard of an

embedded non-alphabetic character.  The new Validations psuedo-license

is added.

version 17:

  Adds new TATTLE record to provide audit trail of all operations.

  Adds restrictions to enforce new password standard.



-------------------------------------------------------------------



Program Name:  OPPS.SAV

Current Version: 3

New Version:  4



Comments: This version on one system for 2 years.  New password standard

enforced.  This will installed only on system 90.



Changes between versions:

version 4:

                                                                Page  3

  Adds new TATTLE record to provide audit trail of all operations.

  Adds restrictions to enforce new password standard.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Program Name:  TITO.SAV

Current Version: 15.13

New Version:  16.3



Comments:  New error messages are provided.  This version on systems 

for 2 years.  No changes affect MAGNUM, and larger files can now be 

stored. (This version is already on 90 and 184.)



Changes between versions:

Version 16.2

------------

This version again changes the code associated with setting the file

"dumped" bit to check the monitor version against P034/K16 to determine

whether to use CLOSE FIL,DMP or to continue using the code installed

in versions 15.14 & 16.1.  [Introduced module GETVER.MAC]



Version 16.1

------------

This version changes the code associated with setting the file dumped

bit.  The "Exclusive ENTER" was a "no-no".  It cloberred license on

files with more license than most operators have.  Fix was to comment

out the "ENTER".



Version 16.0

                                                                Page  4

------------

This version fixes the problem TITO had with counting blocks from

zero "0" instead of one "1" for very large files when they had to

extend across three or more tapes.  



Version 15.14

-------------

This version implements the following reliability enhancements:

  o Permit files greater than <1 reel> + 65,536 pages to be stored.

  o Ignore UFDs with GANs greater than 377777.

  o Compare lookup blocks before and after on a STORE ALL CHANGED to

    only set the DUMPED bit if they match, thus preventing truncation.

  o Let OPER know if NSF or BDA set on a file and which one it is.



New error messages:

  o NEW FILE ... NOT MARKED AS DUMPED.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     We are currently involved upgrading and making current various

programs related to or part of the TYMCOM-X operating system.  These

changes are being implemented in groups/packages of related programs,

eg.: those determining a session in the system (LOGINN, GFD); setting

master license (SETOP, OPPS); processing commands to the operating 

system (LISTER, LOADER, RPG); etc.

     Please make certain these changes are acceptable to the customer,

and notify us of their acceptance.  We strongly recommend/request

that you 'sell' the upgrades to the customer (if necessary):  these

newer versions will be consistent with the Tymshare PDP-10's, and

earlier versions will not remain supported.

     The following documents the proposed upgrade(s) of the operating

system software which we would like to install on system 169.

  


                                                                Page  2


Program Name:  SETOP.SAV

Current Version:  14

New Version:  20



Comments: New version provides greater security.  This version has been 

on one system for 18 months.

     Note that passwords must conform to new standards.



Changes between versions:

Version 20 of SETOP enforces the new TYMNET password standard of an

embedded non-alphabetic character.  The new Validations psuedo-license

is added.

version 17:

  Adds new TATTLE record to provide audit trail of all operations.

  Adds restrictions to enforce new password standard.



-------------------------------------------------------------------



Program Name:  OPPS.SAV

Current Version: 3

New Version:  4



Comments: This version on one system for 2 years.  New password standard

enforced.

version 4:

  Adds new TATTLE record to provide audit trail of all operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------



Program Name:  TITO.SAV

Current Version: 15.13

New Version:  16.3



Comments:  New error messages are provided.  This version on systems 

for 2 years.  No changes affect MAGNUM, and larger files can now be 

stored.



Changes between versions:

Version 16.2

------------

This version again changes the code associated with setting the file

"dumped" bit to check the monitor version against P034/K16 to determine

whether to use CLOSE FIL,DMP or to continue using the code installed

in versions 15.14 & 16.1.  [Introduced module GETVER.MAC]



Version 16.1

------------

This version changes the code associated with setting the file dumped

bit.  The "Exclusive ENTER" was a "no-no".  It cloberred license on

files with more license than most operators have.  Fix was to comment

out the "ENTER".



Version 16.0

------------

This version fixes the problem TITO had with counting blocks from
                                                                Page  4


zero "0" instead of one "1" for very large files when they had to

extend across three or more tapes.  



Version 15.14

-------------

This version implements the following reliability enhancements:

  o Permit files greater than <1 reel> + 65,536 pages to be stored.

  o Ignore UFDs with GANs greater than 377777.

  o Compare lookup blocks before and after on a STORE ALL CHANGED to

    only set the DUMPED bit if they match, thus preventing truncation.

  o Let OPER know if NSF or BDA set on a file and which one it is.



New error messages:

  o NEW FILE ... NOT MARKED AS DUMPED.

  o MISSING FILE ... NOT MARKED AS DUMPED.

  o FILE NOT DUMPED ..., MARKED DO NOT DUMP.

  o FILE NOT DUMPED ..., MARKED BAD ON DISK.

Subject: New directory (NOBACKUP)

As a space-saving-reserving measure, I've created directory (NOBACKUP)
which will hold files which don't need to be backed up, most of which
are being kept around to reserve disk space for when we need to do a
full monitor transmittal (I see one coming soon!)...

Please, under pain of listening to a long tirade of verbal abuse, do NOT
delete any of these files.

I've put last year's accounting files, the transmitted /N *.SAV files,
last year's chkpnt data files, the (OSP)*.SAV files for updated/rebuilt
/N monitors that we have distributed to new and reconfigured systems.

Don't put anything  there without telling me what it is, and don't
delete any of it.  These files will NOT appear on the all-files tapes
and WILL make the bi-weekly backup go faster.

Just a reminder in case it got lost inside the previous message.
Monitor .SAV files built in (OSP) have been moved to directory
(NOBACKUP) on 930, since we only keep a copy on 930 for emergencies
anyway.  They will no longer get backed up.

Just thinking...I wonder how many times somebody does a linear search of
the PGY table.  I can't help but think that performance on 39 isn't what it
should be -- things get slow and I do a HOG and there isn't really anything
running that I would think should make it that slow.  A linear search could
take as long as 75 mS!  If we do one every time a page is mapped, that's
about twice as long as it takes to actually read the page off disk!!!  I
thought you might want to check it out some time.  -Bill

PS - 75 mS ~= 4096 x 2 x 9.16uS based on 12-13 memory references per loop

Just thought you'd be interested...

Subject: .FOCFM - Create frame, NEW STYLE

Remember the bits added to this, 1B17 to run LOGINN, 1B16 to pass license?
I'm looking at what needs to be passed along to a child whenever a job
is started up by a PERP/PCOM/EXEC process.  I've come up with a slightly
longer list than what originally was installed:

	Original		My List
	========		=======
	PPN			PPN
	PRIVS			PRIVS
	AUN			AUN
	Username		Username
				Network Data
				Project Code
	License (if 1B16)	License
				Tru Limit ???
				Core Limit ???

I'm wondering what would break if I added any of these to the standard
list of things to do.  Granted, TRU limit and CORE limit should probably
be set by LOGINN as it is now [LUD DATA], but there has to be a way to
set UPTLOG/LDBLOG and the project-code for royalty & normal accounting.

It may even be reasonable to set these on the LOGIN UUO... I haven't
really looked yet....

Anyway, what have you written which passes license using 1B16?  And how
easy would it be to change it.  I don't know of many programs which even
KNOW about the new format, let alone use it.  It doesn't exist in /K!

Also, new thought:  I'm planning on changing something in this area, and
probably making a new LOGINN which checks to see if things like license
and project code are set already, so as not to haggle with any project-
code validations program if you are running LOGINN in a frame setup by
the .FOCFM FRMOP call.

Please comment now, before I do anything....

Remember the bits added to this, 1B17 to run LOGINN, 1B16 to pass license?
I'm looking at what needs to be passed along to a child whenever a job
is started up by a PERP/PCOM/EXEC process.  I've come up with a slightly
longer list than what originally was installed:

	Original		My List
	========		=======
	PPN			PPN
	PRIVS			PRIVS
	AUN			AUN
	Username		Username
				Network Data
				Project Code
	License (if 1B16)	License
				Tru Limit ???
				Core Limit ???

[ If the child is being "cloned" from the parent, that is, if it is
being created with the same PPN, etc. then it should get all these things
from the parent.  In fact, I believe that since Darren's work, it will
take all these things from the parent, except TRU LIMIT.  Remember that
Core limit is in JBTPRV so it always has been set.  On the other hand, if
the parent is logging it in with a new PPN, etc. and running LOGINN, then
these things are all specified in the LUD (and should be).  I don't think
Darren finished the changes to LOGINN to go with RUN LOGINN IN CHILD.
I'm not sure, this was in progress when I left.  At any rate, it was
intended (and maybe implemented) so that the user's INIT program and
project code verification program would not be run.  
]

I'm wondering what would break if I added any of these to the standard
list of things to do.  Granted, TRU limit and CORE limit should probably
be set by LOGINN as it is now [LUD DATA], but there has to be a way to
set UPTLOG/LDBLOG and the project-code for royalty & normal accounting.

[ I agree.  There should be a write frame attribute and maybe an
argument to CREFRM to specify a special value for UPTLOG.  This will
allow the submited job to be run "as if from the terminal it was
submited from".  The PERP control file would simply retain the UPTLOG of
the frame that submited the job.  I think that LDBLOG should never be set,
rather, change the GETTAB that everybody uses now to use UPTLOG if it
finds LDBLOG 0 or no terminal.  This is the only total solution since
you can't set LDBLOG if there is no terminal.
]

It may even be reasonable to set these on the LOGIN UUO... I haven't
really looked yet....

Anyway, what have you written which passes license using 1B16?  And how
easy would it be to change it.  I don't know of many programs which even
KNOW about the new format, let alone use it.  It doesn't exist in /K!

[ Yes, I have a few, I think all the MAIL stuff does, not sure.  XEXEC
certainly does.  Why do you want to change it? ]

Also, new thought:  I'm planning on changing something in this area, and
probably making a new LOGINN which checks to see if things like license
and project code are set already, so as not to haggle with any project-
code validations program if you are running LOGINN in a frame setup by
the .FOCFM FRMOP call.

[ Yes, I believe that Darren decided to use JLOG=1 and JBTAUN=0 as a
signal to LOGINN to do special stuff.  After all, when you're running
LOGINN, it will set JBTAUN from the LUD.  Also, it should leave JBTPPN
alone if its non-0, but set it to the AUN if its 0.  I don;t think you
want to run INIT program either.   Again, look in Darren's directory to
see if he started any work on LOGINN, it may just need testing. ]

Please comment now, before I do anything....

Craig,
  It seems that my beeper did go off... It so happens that I also set it
down while working around the house earlier, and left it where it couldn't
be heard from the bedroom.  {sigh}  So, at least we know that our system
works when things go wrong.

  Sorry that you had to be bothered...

              CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM



The Executive Board has approved moving forward with Phase I of 
the recommended plan for consolidation of selected field office 
locations into shared ISG Business Centers.

The initial metropolitan areas to be addressed in the plan include 
New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, 
Chicago, Denver, Houston and Dallas.  These eight areas represent 
over 50% of the annual ISG real estate lease expense and personnel 
in field locations.

A task force of real estate management representatives from five 
ISG business organizations will team with Dick Miskell, Director - 
ISG Field Facilities, to develop a specific detailed 
implementation plan and schedule for each metropolitan area.  The 
actual consolidation process will be implemented over a three year 
period and will involve other metropolitan areas.

An executive level Steering Committee comprised of representatives 
from six ISG organizations will be utilized to review and 
recommend policy needs.  These policy recommendations will support 
the implementation and remote office administration needs of the 
shared ISG Business Centers.  Specific areas to be addressed 
include the remote office administrative organization structures, 
office standards and the tenant cost allocation process for real 
estate lease expenses as well as common office services and 
equipment in the shared environment.

These new ISG Business Centers will increase McDonnell Douglas 
visibility in the ISG major market places, optimize office 
services through the larger shared office environment and obtain 
maximum leverage in lease negotiations to reduce long-term real 
estate lease expense.  Please give your support to the task force 
over the next few months to expedite completion of this task 
assignment by the Executive Board.

Subject: Schedule for Monday 

I will be at a meeting for the "perp replacement" project at 3:00PM.

I would like to get together with you (Joe & Osman at least) for about
an hour or so before that meeting to discuss changes to LOGINN, INITIA,
the operating system and (possibly other cusps) to support the project.
Much that was thought to be completed already has not been done, and I
feel that some discussion as to the final design is in order.  I don't
believe that the decisions should be "arbitrarily" mine, without some
discussion.

Craig, you are welcome, but need not take the time, since this is more
of an information pooling and preliminary strategy meeting.

I plan to be in by 1:PM.  /Carl

Crash table data has been run using the corrected data files CRSHID.YAM
and CRSHID.ALL which includes the MAY totals.  UUOCON:INSSIM+2 changed
to ERRCON:ILLINS+2 and enpty module names filled in.

Note:  Osman, do we care for our records whether we call it INSSIM+2 or
       ILLINS+2 ???  since INSSIM+2 is really only valid on an F3?  I've
       tried to keep it ILLINS+2...

Anyway, I guess we can bring the results to the tuesday meeting.  In case
anyone has noticed, 6 ILLINS+2 crashes last month, NONE are the zero-UPT
type crashes as best I can tell from the PC contents.  Can we determine
from looking at what is coded in MUR whether there were considered software?
or hardware?

Subject: The new 2020, host 95. 

There has been a delay in bringing this host up on the network.  Dennis
Ernst, of Tymnet NTD, is responsible for the hardware and code for the
micro-TymBase which supports this host.  He did not check the hardware
last week, as originally planned.  He is out of town until next Monday,
and has no time scheduled to visit our site (to my knowledge).  I
suspect that he will not be able to be here before mid-week, next week.
Host 95 cannot be brought into the network until he does his part.

Subject: PACKAGE NAMES 

To allow access through the TRABAS data base, package names must be
restricted to 10 characters, max.  Craig and I have decided upon a
convention for package naming, based upon this restriction.

The package names, for the "Software name" line of the transmittal form,
and for further abbreviation into the file names for the package FDM
files will have this format:

	nnnnnn.PKG
(where:  "nnnnnn" = 6-character abbreviation of the package name.)

For creating the FDM file names, the first four characters of this
6-character abbreviation will be used.  The following "software names"
will be used for the package names:

PACKAGE NAME			'SOFTWARE' NAME
------------			---------------
operating system		OPRSYS.PKG
monitor invoked procedures	MONPRC.PKG
load complex			LDCPLX.PKG
startup				STARTU.PKG
session				SESSIO.PKG

Subject: Pkging: 2020s 

In the first round, we will not create any packages for any of the 2020
hosts, unless the the software on the 2020s won't require updating, or
the updating the software in the packages won't require updating any
software in any other packages.  In the first round, in most cases the
package to create will be the package for the PDP-10's.  We will create
a zero level (universal) package only if that will be the final
configuration:  only if the software on the 2020's is exactly the same
as the software on the PDP-10's.  If there is to be a "2" level package
(for the 2020's only), it will not be assembled until after the packages
for all the Tymshare PDP-10s are completed.

Craig, what is the status of the 2020 hardware?  Somebody move all three
RM03 disk drives over to the 780.  Is this a temporary arrangement for testing
out the RM03 drives?  When will I be allowed to try to bring up TOPS-10 on the
2020?  I see that Rhett got his RP06 connected to the 2060, but what about the
2nd RP06?  (As of Sunday, it was sitting in our lobby, and is missing all 4
Massbus connectors.)

         business units offers ISG a unique opportunity.  Bob and Gary 
         will share responsibility for fostering intercomponent 
         relationships to maximize the benefits of this strength.  
         Strategy implementation and strategic and operating results 
         will also be shared responsibilities.

     3.  Temporarily continuing to report to Bob will be McDonnell 
         Douglas Financial Transaction Systems, McDonnell Douglas 
         Information Processing, Dynatax, Unitax and MSGI.  Most of 
         these should be transitioned to Gary by the end of this year.

     4.  I am very enthusiastic about the new ISG headquarters 
         structure and especially about the two new executives who 
         constitute the headquarters team.  Both are seasoned 
         executives with outstanding records, both are highly 
         action-oriented, both know the business intimately, both have 
         strong marketing backgrounds, both are strong advocates of our 
         new culture, both have contributed greatly to the ISG vision 
         and organizational structure as it has evolved, both are team 
         builders, both are outstanding, demanding leaders.   They also 
         represent a good balance in that Bob has extensive large 
         company experience, will continue to be located in St. Louis, 
         and is especially strong in strategic vision and in broad 
         communications/team building.  Gary on the other hand has 
         extensive smaller company experience, will continue to be 
         located in Southern California, and is especially strong in 
         tight operating control and in executive team building.


     5.  Needless to say, the Blue and Gold Sectors are hereby 
         dissolved, as promised.  With essentially all the business 
         units reporting to Gary, ISG will now be run as one integrated 
         group.

     6.  For now there will be a centralized finance support center in 
         St. Louis to provide financial support for those business 
         units which do not yet have fully functional financial 
         organizations.  The goal will be to achieve business unit 
         independence and have the people in this organization placed 
         within those business units no later than the end of 1986.  In 
         addition, decisions on how business units will continue to 
         obtain human resources and law support will be announced soon.

     7.  Concurrent with Bob's and Gary's promotions, Rich Calvert, 
         Jerry Causley, and Vern Smith are promoted to the positions of 
         President of McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information 
         Systems, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International, 
         and McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems, respectively.

     8.  With these actions the top level organizational structure of 
         ISG is complete with the one exception of the communications 
         industry business unit.  That awaits the completion of the 
         study by the communications industry strategic task force.  
         That should be accomplished by the end of June.

     9.  With the implementation of this organizational structure my 
         active role in ISG will be complete, and I shall return to my 
         other role as President of MDC.  I can do that with great 
         peace of mind and confidence that ISG is in the hands of an 
         outstanding leadership team.

In the first round, we will not create any packages for any of the 2020
hosts, unless the the software on the 2020s won't require updating.  In
these cases (probably very few) the package for the 2020's will be for
"archive only".

In the first round, in most cases the package to create will be the
package for the PDP-10's.  We will create a zero level (universal)
package only if that will be the final configuration:  only if the
software on the 2020's is exactly the same as the software on the
PDP-10's.  If there is to be a "2" level package (for the 2020's only)
with any software updating, it will not be assembled until after the
packages for all the Tymshare PDP-10s are completed.

SUBJ:    Software Support Responsibility for Fayez-Sarofim

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is our understanding that "Tymshare's" responsibility for software
updates for Fayez-Sarofim extends only to Magnum software.  If that is
the case, we have no responsibility for providing Operating System or
Utility updates.  We do not have access to a copy of the contract here,
as far as we can determine.  This inability to locate the contract may
be due to changes in personnel and responsibilities in the sales
organization, occurring around the time of and/or due to the purchase of
Tymshare by McDonnell-Douglas.

We will not install any new software for the Operating Sytem or the
Utilities until we have seen a copy of the contract.  Michael Chinn
tells me that you will be forwarding a copy of this contract to us.  We
await it with baited breath.

Thank you!

Michael Sugden will mail Terry Griffin a copy of their contract in order to
assist us in determining our obligations in providing them with software
updates.  Terry has agreed to forward a copy to me.  I assured Micheal that
we fully intend to provide him with the upgrades once this issue is resolved.
Although he was very understanding, he is anxious to get started.
 
I have reviewed the program updates for DIRIT, PIP, FILCOM, UNDELE, and CHKPNT
with Michael and he finds them acceptable.  He requests that the updates be
copied to his SSINSTALL directory.  As we discussed, this will allow him to
install them at his convenience.  Please let me know when new versions have been
transfered as I would like to notify Michael of their availability.

P.S.  Terry,

      Would you also send a copy of the infamous "Contract" to Dennis Coffey?
      Thanks for all your help!

What do we need in the way of Purchase-Order or Requisition to go
ahead and print some microfiche?

Need to know since we have an impending monitor release, and I think
there are some revisions to some standard software, including listings
we ought to be making on microfiche as we generate each package for
the packaging project.

As soon as I have a PO/REQ or whatever we need, then I can get with
Dennis Coffey to show them what they need to do to generate fiche.
I don't know how "open" we can make the requisition?  I'd hate to
have to get a new one every time we want to print a set of listings
to microfiche....

  4) SET AUTOLOGOUT will now default to the inactivitiy timeout if no
     value is given... zero may still leave flags set... will fix!
  5) Part of #1, STOPCD table pointer in place.  Need to build actual
     data area and setup pointers in COMMON & UUOCON.
  6) Part of #2, we will probably use the left-half bits for TYMCOM-X
     features and the right-half bits for equivalent features that DEC
     has in TOPS-10.
  7) C930 is now X930.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The file (SPOOL)NODPRI has been updated on all CEGI hosts, including 90
(except host 184, which does not have a SPOOL directory).  The update
was completed by 5 am, GMT, 25 Jun 85.  The association of node numbers
with printer locations is now consistent with the information currently
entered into the data base on host 8 by System's Resource Allocation.

The delay in responding to your request for this update was due to the
need to correct errors in the file and confirm the contained
information.  Procedures and policies are being established to effect
the updating on a monthly basis, so the current problem should not
re-occur.

I hope and believe that all is now correct.  If host 184 should have the
NODPRI file for SPOOL, please let me know where it should be.  If the
node to printer correspondence is in error, please let SRA and me know.

Subject: FCR.E+4 crashes 

I've taken a preliminary look at all of them.  There is no set pattern
except for the function which they were attempting to execute.

FCR.E+4 is reached when there is either an FCREATE (VCREATE UUO) or
MAPPING (CHANIO FUNCTION .CHMFP) error.  In the crash case, it is clear
that the code first does a CREATE-FILE-PAGE then attempts to map that
same file page into memory.  That MAP is what appears to be failing.

I've patched all the systems which have this crash occurring to capture
the UUO AC before it clears the page number part.  Without the page #
in monitor memory it is difficult to verify that the page already exists
in memory...  I await the next crash!   {Sigh}.

SUBJ:	Previously proposed software upgrades for Mallinkrodt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Requests for Mallinkrodt's acceptance of the listed software
have been sent.  The following list does not detail the changes in the
new versions.  That information was listed in the requests.

Software	Function
--------	--------
DIRIT		DECLARE, DELETE, DIRECTORY, FILES & RENAME commands.
PIP		COPY command.
FILCOM		DIFFER command.
UNDELE		Provides "soft" (recoverable) file deletes.  (New)
SETOP		Program for managers to validate users for "operator"
		license.
OPPS		Program for users with "operator" license to change
		their license password.
TITO		Program to store individual files, disk to tape, and
		restore files from tape to disk.
ASP		Program to store disk to tape, as structured on disk.



	Your requests to Mallinkrodt for acceptance of upgrades to
Operating System software for their host 169 have gone unanswered.  We
are thus interpreting this as a lack of acceptance.  We are thereby
initiating the process of distributing the referenced software to all
hosts which can use this software, excluding Mallinkrodt's host 169.
This distribution of software will be the only offer of these revision
in the foreseeable future.

	Mallinkrodt has contracted with "Tymshare" (McDonnell-Douglas)
for operating system maintence and upgrades at the cost to them of $1400
per month.  We are attempting to fulfill our portion of this agreement
with this offer of upgrades.  The information we are communicating to
Mallinkrodt about the upgrades may not be sufficient for them to base an
acceptance.  If this is the case, we are most willing to provide what
information they need, if possible.

	If we receive no answer from you before the end of the first
work week in July (i.e., Wednesday, July 3), we will assume that
Mallinkrodt has no need or desire for the upgrades mentioned.

	Further requests for acceptance of other software upgrades will
follow.

	Thank you,
	Dennis

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi!

For your information:  I have, through some research, obtained a copy of
our contract with Fayez.  You have been quite right:  we are contracted
to provide them with software support.  We will do so with as much speed
as is possible, considering the amount of research involved.  

We believe that Fayez is planning to soon change to MAGNUM on a VAX
machine.  If so, they may now be somewhat resistant to changing software
that they have grown quite familiar with--this is the case with our
other 2020 customers.  We recognize that this does not mean they will
not expect software support for their VAX, when delivered.  We are and
will be willing and able to provide them with contracted support.

I hope this memo indicates our clearer understanding of our support
responsibilities.  If I am wrong about their plans to move to a VAX, I
would appreciate clarification.  

Thanks!

     The Management Council will provide feedback on a full range of 
     business unit and staff activities.  Together, these groups 
     constitute a valuable communications and participative management 
     tool that can go far to enhance and support ISG's short-term and 
     long-term strategies.

          As a further clarification, these reporting relationships are 
          illustrated by the attached preliminary organizational chart.  
          It is important to note that this chart shows only reporting 
          relationships, not rank.

          I hope this clears up some of the confusion that resulted from 
          our recent top management changes.

     To:          MDC-HQ and Corporate Office Lists A-D

     Subject:     FORMATION OF ISG FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION 
                  ORGANIZATION


     I am pleased to announce, effective immediately, the formation 
     of the ISG Finance and Administration Organization and 
     appointments to key positions in that organization.

     D. J. (Woody) Garrity is appointed Staff Vice President - 
     Administration for ISG.  Based in St. Louis, Woody will be 
     responsible for policy formulation and coordination of ISG 
     consolidated reporting and other special tasks in the areas of 
     management information systems, policy management, facilities, 
     procurement, and export control.  In addition, he will continue 
     to direct the centralized administrative support activities in 
     St. Louis.  These activities will not become part of the Group 
     staff; it is our intention to transfer substantially all of the 
     operations aspects of the centralized administration support 
     activities to the business units, while creating a lean policy 
     formulation and coordination staff at the Group level during 
     the next two months.  In the case of Information Resource 
     Management, however, this transfer will be timed with the 
     establishment of fully functional financial systems and 
     organizations in the business units.

     Ray A. Mundloch is appointed Controller for ISG.  Ray will be 
     based in St. Louis and will be responsible for establishing 
     accounting policy, reporting calendars and formats, and for 
     preparation of the monthly Group financial statements.  In 
     addition, he will monitor compliance with generally accepted 
     accounting principles, with ISG and Corporate accounting 
     policies and practices, and with the system of internal 
     accounting controls in each ISG business unit.  He will also 
     serve as the Corporate interface for historical financial 
     data.  Ray will continue to be responsible for the centralized 
     finance support center in St. Louis.  As with the centralized 
     administrative activities, these functions will not become part 
     of the Group staff.  As previously announced, the goal is to 
     achieve business unit independence and to have the people in 
     this centralized organization placed within those business 
     units no later than the end of 1986.

     I will function, on an acting basis, as Staff Vice President - 
     Financial Planning and Analysis for the Group.  The 
     responsibilities of this position are forward-looking in nature 
     and include working with each of the ISG business units on the 
     annual operating plan, forecasts and outlooks, and on reviews 
     of special financial studies and proposals.  This function will 
     also prepare and publish forward-looking consolidated ISG 
     financial information and will serve as the Corporate interface 
     for this information.







     A. J. (Arnie) Hyde is appointed to the position of Director - 
     International Financial Planning and Analysis.  In this capacity, 
     Arnie will be located in Hemel Hempstead, England, and work with 
     both the Staff Vice President - Financial Planning and Analysis 
     and with the Group Controller on financial matters pertaining to 
     McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company - UK and 
     McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International Company.  
     Additionally, he will serve as the Finance Director of McDonnell 
     Douglas UK Ltd. (MDUKL), with special emphasis on UK tax and cash 
     coordination activities for ISG and for McDonnell Douglas.

     Woody and Ray will soon be publishing additional administrative 
     bulletins describing their functions in more detail and 
     announcing appointments.

     Subject:     FORMATION OF ISG HUMAN RESOURCES ORGANIZATION



     Effective immediately, Mike Becker is appointed Staff 
     Vice President - Human Resources for the ISG.  In his new 
     position, Mike will report to me and will be responsible for 
     Group Human Resource activities which include:

          -   Policy Formulation and Coordination

          -   Compensation and Benefits

          -   Human Resource Management

          -   Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action

          -   Employee Attitude Surveys

          -   Human Resource support for Group staff organizations

     Mike is also responsible for coordinating activities among the 
     Human Resource organizations within the business units.

     In addition, two important programs that require consistent 
     administration across all of ISG will report to Mike:

          -   Management and Professional Development, under 
              Ken Best.  (Other training activities, including 
              technical, sales, and product- or job-specific skills 
              training will be the responsibility of the individual 
              business units.)

          -   Placement, Advancement, Counseling and Training (PACT), 
              under Jerry Sexauer.

     Both of these programs benefit the entire ISG and are most 
     appropriately administered at the Group level.

     One of the ISG's most important goals is to achieve business 
     unit independence and to decentralize as many staff functions as 
     possible by no later than the end of 1986.  In the meantime, we 
     will use regional support centers to provide staff support for 
     those business units that are not yet self-sufficient.  In the 
     area of Human Resources, this approach will be carried out as 
     follows:



          -   Wylie Taylor is responsible for Human Resource support 
              for McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.  He 
              will have a parallel responsibility for companies in 
              the West which do not have their own Human Resource 
              functions.  Those organizations are:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company

              -   Group Staff organizations located on the West Coast

              Wylie reports to Vern Smith, President, 
              McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.

          -   In the East, a position for managing Human Resource 
              support, yet to be filled, will report to me.  Until an 
              appropriate individual is named to this position, 
              Mike Becker will have acting responsibility to provide 
              Human Resource support for the following companies:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering 
                  Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Information Processing Company

              -   MSGI, Dynatax and Unitax

          -   Human Resource organizations that already exist within 
              business units will continue to support their 
              individual business units.  Those organizations are:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International 
                  Company

     ISG now has an efficient Human Resource framework.  Further 
     announcements will be made in the coming months as staffing 
     decisions are made at the Group and business unit level.  In the 
     meantime, I urge you to cooperate with all Human ResoReceived: from C26.Tymnet by X930.Tymnet; Fri, 28 Jun 85 17:21:58 PDT

SUBJ:	Previously proposed software upgrades for Mallinkrodt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Requests for Mallinkrodt's acceptance of the listed software
have been sent.  The following list does not detail the changes in the
new versions.  That information was listed in the requests.

Software	Function
--------	--------
DIRIT		DECLARE, DELETE, DIRECTORY, FILES & RENAME commands.
PIP		COPY command.
FILCOM		DIFFER command.
UNDELE		Provides "soft" (recoverable) file deletes.  (New)
SETOP		Program for managers to validate users for "operator"
		license.
OPPS		Program for users with "operator" license to change
		their license password.
TITO		Program to store individual files, disk to tape, and
		restore files from tape to disk.
ASP		Program to store disk to tape, as structured on disk.



	Your requests to Mallinkrodt for acceptance of upgrades to
Operating System software for their host 169 have gone unanswered.  We
are thus interpreting this as a lack of acceptance.  We are thereby
initiating the process of distributing the referenced software to all
hosts which can use this software, excluding Mallinkrodt's host 169.
This distribution of software will be the only offer of these revision
in the foreseeable future.

	Mallinkrodt has contracted with "Tymshare" (McDonnell-Douglas)
for operating system maintence and upgrades at the cost to them of $1400
per month.  We are attempting to fulfill our portion of this agreement
with this offer of upgrades.  The information we are communicating to
Mallinkrodt about the upgrades may not be sufficient for them to base an
acceptance.  If this is the case, we are most willing to provide what
information they need, if possible.

	If we receive no answer from you before the end of the first
work week in July (i.e., Wednesday, July 3), we will assume that
Mallinkrodt has no need or desire for the upgrades mentioned.

	Further requests for acceptance of other software upgrades will
follow.

	Thank you,
	Dennis

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi!

For your information:  I have, through some research, obtained a copy of
our contract with Fayez.  You have been quite right:  we are contracted
to provide them with software support.  We will do so with as much speed
as is possible, considering the amount of research involved.  

We believe that Fayez is planning to soon change to MAGNUM on a VAX
machine.  If so, they may now be somewhat resistant to changing software
that they have grown quite familiar with--this is the case with our
other 2020 customers.  We recognize that this does not mean they will
not expect software support for their VAX, when delivered.  We are and
will be willing and able to provide them with contracted support.

I hope this memo indicates our clearer understanding of our support
responsibilities.  If I am wrong about their plans to move to a VAX, I
would appreciate clarification.  

Thanks!

     Committee.  Its members are:

                     Mike Becker                     Gary Liebl
                     Jerry Causley                   Leo Mirowitz

                     Bob Fischer                     Paul Wiedenmann


     This group will meet monthly to make participative decisions on 
     important ISG matters.

     A second new group, the ISG Management Council, will meet in 
     conjunction with each Quarterly Review.  The Council's members 
     are:

                     Mike Becker                     Vern Hart
                     Ted Bellan                      Gene Horn

                     Rich Calvert                    Leo Mirowitz

                     Bob Fischer                     Buck Yoder

     The Management Council will provide feedback on a full range of 
     business unit and staff activities.  Together, these groups 
     constitute a valuable communications and participative management 
     tool that can go far to enhance and support ISG's short-term and 
     long-term strategies.

          illustrated by the attached preliminary organizational chart.  
          It is important to note that this chart shows only reporting 
          relationships, not rank.

          I hope this clears up some of the confusion that resulted from 
          our recent top management changes.

     To:          MDC-HQ and Corporate Office Lists A-D

     Subject:     FORMATION OF ISG FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION 
                  ORGANIZATION


     I am pleased to announce, effective immediately, the formation 
     of the ISG Finance and Administration Organization and 
     appointments to key positions in that organization.

     D. J. (Woody) Garrity is appointed Staff Vice President - 
     Administration for ISG.  Based in St. Louis, Woody will be 
     responsible for policy formulation and coordination of ISG 
     consolidated reporting and other special tasks in the areas of 
     management information systems, policy management, facilities, 
     procurement, and export control.  In addition, he will continue 
     to direct the centralized administrative support activities in 
     St. Louis.  These activities will not become part of the Group 
     staff; it is our intention to transfer substantially all of the 
     operations aspects of the centralized administration support 
     activities to the business units, while creating a lean policy 
     formulation and coordination staff at the Group level during 
     the next two months.  In the case of Information Resource 
     Management, however, this transfer will be timed with the 
     establishment of fully functional financial systems and 
     organizations in the business units.

     Ray A. Mundloch is appointed Controller for ISG.  Ray will be 
     based in St. Louis and will be responsible for establishing 
     accounting policy, reporting calendars and formats, and for 
     preparation of the monthly Group financial statements.  In 
     addition, he will monitor compliance with generally accepted 
     accounting principles, with ISG and Corporate accounting 
     policies and practices, and with the system of internal 
     accounting controls in each ISG business unit.  He will also 
     serve as the Corporate interface for historical financial 
     data.  Ray will continue to be responsible for the centralized 
     finance support center in St. Louis.  As with the centralized 
     administrative activities, these functions will not become part 
     of the Group staff.  As previously announced, the goal is to 
     achieve business unit independence and to have the people in 
     this centralized organization placed within those business 
     units no later than the end of 1986.

     I will function, on an acting basis, as Staff Vice President - 
     Financial Planning and Analysis for the Group.  The 
     responsibilities of this position are forward-looking in nature 
     and include working with each of the ISG business units on the 
     annual operating plan, forecasts and outlooks, and on reviews 
     of special financial studies and proposals.  This function will 
     also prepare and publish forward-looking consolidated ISG 
     financial information and will serve as the Corporate interface 
     for this information.







     A. J. (Arnie) Hyde is appointed to the position of Director - 
     International Financial Planning and Analysis.  In this capacity, 
     Arnie will be located in Hemel Hempstead, England, and work with 
     both the Staff Vice President - Financial Planning and Analysis 
     and with the Group Controller on financial matters pertaining to 
     McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company - UK and 
     McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International Company.  
     Additionally, he will serve as the Finance Director of McDonnell 
     Douglas UK Ltd. (MDUKL), with special emphasis on UK tax and cash 
     coordination activities for ISG and for McDonnell Douglas.

     Woody and Ray will soon be publishing additional administrative 
     bulletins describing their functions in more detail and 
     announcing appointments.

     Mike is also responsible for coordinating activities among the 
     Human Resource organizations within the business units.

     In addition, two important programs that require consistent 
     administration across all of ISG will report to Mike:

          -   Management and Professional Development, under 
              Ken Best.  (Other training activities, including 
              technical, sales, and product- or job-specific skills 
              training will be the responsibility of the individual 
              business units.)

          -   Placement, Advancement, Counseling and Training (PACT), 
              under Jerry Sexauer.

     Both of these programs benefit the entire ISG and are most 
     appropriately administered at the Group level.

     One of the ISG's most important goals is to achieve business 
     unit independence and to decentralize as many staff functions as 
     possible by no later than the end of 1986.  In the meantime, we 
     will use regional support centers to provide staff support for 
     those business units that are not yet self-sufficient.  In the 
     area of Human Resources, this approach will be carried out as 
     follows:



          -   Wylie Taylor is responsible for Human Resource support 
              for McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.  He 
              will have a parallel responsibility for companies in 
              the West which do not have their own Human Resource 
              functions.  Those organizations are:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company

              -   Group Staff organizations located on the West Coast

              Wylie reports to Vern Smith, President, 
              McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.

          -   In the East, a position for managing Human Resource 
              support, yet to be filled, will report to me.  Until an 
              appropriate individual is named to this position, 
              Mike Becker will have acting responsibility to provide 
              Human Resource support for the following companies:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering 
                  Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Information Processing Company

              -   MSGI, Dynatax and Unitax

          -   Human Resource organizations that already exist within 
              business units will continue to support their 
              individual business units.  Those organizations are:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International 
                  Company

     ISG now has an efficient Human Resource framework.  Further 
     announcements will be made in the coming months as staffing 
     decisions are made at the Group and business unit level.  In the 
     meantime, I urge you to cooperate with all Human Resource staffs 
     as they work to provide us with effective and responsive Human 
     Resource support.

     Effective immediately, Bernie Hathaway is appointed Vice 
     President - Productivity for ISG, reporting to me.  In this 
     position, Bernie will be responsible for championing 
     productivity programs for all ISG business units and will work 
     with the business units to develop effective productivity 
     improvement activities that are consistent with both ISG and MDC 
     standards and objectives.

     To facilitate this process, productivity executives representing 
     each business unit will report to Bernie on a dotted line basis 
     as they implement productivity activities appropriate to their 
     respective business units.

     Bernie's first order of business will be to assimilate all 
     former Blue Sector productivity efforts and integrate them with 
     former Gold Sector activities.  I am counting on your support 
     for Bernie's efforts to provide a practical and efficient 
     framework for coordinating ISG's activities in the vitally 
     important area of productivity improvement.

     Subject:     CHANGES IN FORMER BLUE/GOLD SECTOR STAFF FUNCTIONS



     Dissolution of the ISG sectors has required us to reassign 
     several staff activities, including the following:

         -    Library Services (St. Louis) is now the responsibility 
              of Ted Bellan, President - McDonnell Douglas 
              Information Processing Company.

         -    Guest Services (St. Louis) is now the responsibility of 
              Dave Rousseau, Staff Vice President - ISG Marketing.  
              This function currently provides an executive briefing 
              suite for use by all ISG businesses.  As budgets 
              permit, ISG  executive briefing facilities will be 
              opened in additional locations.

         -    Dick Schenk, formerly Director of Planning - ISG Blue 
              Sector, will, along with his organization, report to 
              Gary Liebl.  As Director - Operating Planning for ISG, 
              Dick will assist Gary in developing, analyzing, and 
              managing ISG business unit operating plans, for which 
              Gary is now responsible as Group Operating Officer.

         -    Alan Griffiths, formerly Director - Strategic Planning 
              for the Gold Sector, will now report to Wayne Hudgins, 
              Director of Planning - ISG, to consolidate ISG-wide 
              planning within the Group Marketing and Planning 
              function.  Alan brings a depth of experience in 
              technology consulting that will be invaluable to ISG's 
              strategic planning.

     Other steps involved in our transition to a unified ISG are 
     outlined in other ISG Administrative Bulletins.

     Effective immediately, Charlie Dignan, ISG's Staff Vice President 
     - Corporate Accounts, will report to me.  Charlie formerly 
     reported to John McDonnell, Chairman of the ISG Executive Board.

     Charlie will continue his efforts to ensure that ISG appropriately 
     coordinates its sales activities within our very largest accounts 
     and prospects.

     I am counting on you to give Charlie your support as he works with 
     us to ensure that ISG provides the best possible customer service 
     and that we identify all the business opportunities that our 
     biggest customers represent.

Subject:      MCDONNELL DOUGLAS COMPUTER SYSTEMS COMPANY 
              MANUFACTURING OPERATION, REDEFINITION OF 
              RESPONSIBILITIES


The reorganization of the Gold Sector Manufacturing Operation 
was announced by Gary E. Liebl, ISG Executive Board Member, 
in his Administrative Bulletin 85-031, dated March 18, 1985.  
The reorganization announced at that time was in response to 
the recommendation made by the Special Task Force formed in 
1984 with the purpose of determining how the capabilities of 
all the manufacturing and procurement resources within ISG 
could best be utilized strategically and tactically.

As the needs of the Computer Systems Company and the 
Information Systems Group increase requiring more of my time 
and attention, I find it necessary at this time to remove 
myself from the acting position of Senior Vice President, 
Manufacturing.

Greg Lawson will continue to function with the title of Vice 
President, Manufacturing for the McDonnell Douglas Computer 
Systems Company.  In addition, however, as an expansion and 
redefinition of his responsiblities, Greg will assume full 
direction of the worldwide manufacturing operations of the 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.  Greg's 
additional responsibilities become effective June 10, 1985.

Reporting directly to Greg will be the people with 
manufacturing responsibilities formerly reporting to me.  
They are:  Barrie Laver, Director & General Manager, 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Limited;  Willie Jones, 
Managing Director, Microdata - Limited, Barbados;  John Lee, 
Director, Manufacturing Control;  Bob Smith, Director, 
Product Assurance;  Jim Ball, Vice President - General 
Manager, Distributed Systems Company and Thom Kelley, 
Director, Tymnet Manufacturing.

Your support of Greg in his expanded role, his direct reports 
and all engaged in the manufacturing process, will be 
sincerely appreciated.

     Subject: PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT:  MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
              INFORMATION PROCESSING COMPANY - DATA CENTER 
              OPERATIONS




     1.  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I announce the 
         appointment of A. Ann Lazerus to the position of 
         Director, Production Services - St. Louis, within MDIPC 
         Data Center Operations.  She is replacing Dave D. Borlin 
         who has accepted a key position within the Corporate IRM 
         Staff function.

     2.  Ann will be responsible for St. Louis based data 
         processing services that support ISG shared processing 
         and dedicated processing.  Such services include IBM and 
         CDC based mainframe services, Data Entry, Data Control 
         and Data Output operations and all associated Production 
         Support processes such as Storage Management, Scheduling 
         and Quality Control.

     3.  Ann's career in data processing began in 1962 with System 
         Development Corporation and has continued to progress 
         within and outside of McDonnell Douglas Corporation with 
         increasing technical and managerial responsibilities.  
         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the 
         University of California at Berkeley in 1974.

     4.  Her most recent assignment is that of a chair position in 
         ISG's Professional and Managerial Development Program.  
         Ann was among the first group accepted into this vital 
         ISG program.  Her previous position was Manager, 
         Production Audit, within the McDonnell Douglas Health 
         Information Systems Group.









     5.  Concurrent with this promotion of Ann, we send our 
         heartfelt appreciation and best wishes to Dave Borlin as 
         he moves into his new role.

     6.  Your cooperation and support of Ann in this position that 
         is so vital to customer satisfaction will be appreciated.

since February of 1984.  This May, another piece was put into place:
IACS is now composed of five regional AC groups plus two national
consulting and support groups.
 
EASTERN REGION                     Mark Dresner, Cynthia Shen (RCM),
                                   Dee Sim, Carol Stefan, Roy Vincent
 
NORTHEASTERN REGION                Pat Randall, Margaret Scanlan,
                                   Bruce Watkins (RCM), John Zeder
 
CENTRAL REGIONS                    Carolyn Calzavara (RCM), Steve
                                   Feldman, Al Herbach, Bruce Keating
 
SOUTH CENTRAL REGION               Satish Akki, Sue Bachmann (RCM),
                                   D'Juanna Beer, Carol Burkett,
                                   Firouz Haghighi, Marla McBryde, and
                                   Linda Oliskel
 
WESTERN REGION                     Mike Connors, Jeri Mearns, Chris
                                   Park, Nancy Shelton (RCM), Shirley
                                   Steele, and Warren Tang

CONSULTING SERVICES                Diane Bateman, Karen Bregar, Steven
                                   Eng, Bryan Louviere, Manager, and
                                   Tony Rich
 
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT     Edie Adams, Robert Klute, Neil
                                   Macintyre, Manager, and Gary
                                   Masters
 
TERRY FUJIMOTO'S SECRETARY         Debbie Jones
 
THEIR MISSION . . . .
 
The organization's mission, according to Terry, is to bring business
in the door and to keep the business we already have.
 
THEIR LOCATIONS . . . .
 
The ACs and RCMs (Regional Consulting Managers) in thirteen field
offices are strategically located to provide local support to the
field sales force.  They also serve as contacts for clients who need
technical help.
 
THEIR FUNCTION . . . .
 
The function of the ACs has always been to provide presales and
postsales support and customer training, and to do small development
projects.  Within the new organization, ACs will continue to do all of
these things.  But they will be directing more of their efforts toward
presales support.  The hotline will take over some of their postsales
support duties, SDS will do more of the development work, and Terry
expects to see more of the training taken over by other ACS
organizations.  The ACs will then have more time for strategizing with
the sales people to sign new business.
 
CONSULTING SERVICES . . . .
 
The people in the Consulting Services group are the ACs' ACs.  Their
depth of experience enables them to help the ACs with the
opportunities that are larger and/or more technically complicated.
 
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT . . . .
 
To do their job, the Consulting Services people need to know where to
get answers to their own questions and those of the ACs, and they need
people in key areas who can answer their questions quickly.  That's
the function of the people in Program Management and Support.  Each
has an area of specific expertise that the Consulting Services people
may not necessarily have.  They provide program management support to
make sure we deliver what has been promised, can bill according to the
sales agreement, and can meet customer deadlines.
 
According to Terry, the IACS organization is positioned as the primary
ACS contact for all sales organizations, key customer accounts, and
other McDonnell Douglas business units.  On the average, each member
is responsible for more than $1 million in annual revenue.  "We intend
to invest in this group to accomplish our part in 'Building the
Vision'.  I believe we have the necessary critical mass, the right
people, and the management support", says Terry.

IACS will also act as a focal point for anyone who needs ACS
information or services.  If you don't know who to contact with your
technical or marketing questions, send an OnTyme to ACS.HELP.

To:          All ISG Employees (Including MDAIS)

Subject:     EXECUTIVE BRIEFING CENTER PHOTO EVENT



As many of you know, we are remodeling our St. Louis Executive 
Briefing Center in Bldg. 300.  The remodeled area will provide us 
with a facility in which we will be proud to host our customers 
and visitors.

Currently, the entrance to the area has a large display of 
photographs from the Missouri Botanical Garden, which were taken 
by Jack Jennings, Director of Sales in the Diversified Information 
Systems Company.  We think it would be fun to use photographs 
taken by other employees throughout the area.  If you are 
interested in having your work displayed, please submit your 
entries to Al Schikore, Dept. I018, Bldg. 301, Level 2W, Post A5, 
no later than 15 July 1985.  Photographs will be selected for 
display by a panel of distinguished ISG judges.  In order to be 
considered, entries must meet the following guidelines:

     -   All photos must be the original work and property of the
         submitting ISG employees or their families.

     -   Entries should be submitted as prints or slides along 
         with the name, address and title of the submitter as well 
         as a brief description of the subject.  (We will attempt 
         to return all materials submitted, but you should not 
         submit your only copy of a treasured photo or slide.)

If a photo is selected for exhibition, it will be enlarged (if 
appropriate), matted, framed and displayed in the area, with 
credit given to the artist.  As photos are rotated out of the 
exhibition, the artists will receive their photos, as they were 
displayed, for their own personal use.

I want to wish all entrants the best of luck.  I am really looking 
forward to seeing the results of the event.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP     BULLETIN        DATE: 18 JUNE '85



To:          ISG Lists A-D

Subject:     INTERIM ORGANIZATION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FINANCIAL 
             TRANSACTION SYSTEMS COMPANY




As you may recall, the Administrative Bulletin that announced the 
formation of the McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems 
Company (AB ISG-85-61, 3 May 1985) indicated that I would act as 
President of that organization until a permanent president is 
selected.  In the meantime, however, we have a lot of work to do.  
We must develop a business plan to introduce the new product lines 
recommended by the Strategic Task Force and agreed upon by the ISG 
Executive Board.  In addition, such opportunities as credit 
reporting and loan authorization demand further study.        

To ensure that this work continues to progress, I am announcing an 
interim organization that will permit us to function in an orderly 
manner until a new president is named and can participate in 
building a permanent organization.  Effective immediately, the 
following people report directly to me:

David Jung, as Vice President-Credit Reporting Development.  David 
was Tymshare's Vice President of Strategic Planning before 
becoming a member of the Financial Services Task Force.  He is 
responsible for the continued exploration of credit reporting and 
loan authorization opportunities.

John Mazzola, as Vice President-Check Card Development.  Before he 
became Chairman of the Financial Services Task Force, John was 
Director of Corporate Marketing in the former McAuto.  He assumes 
responsibility for planning and initiating developmental and pilot 
activities in those product lines approved by the Executive Board, 
including debit cards and electronic check-cashing cards.

Jeff Baer, as Executive Assistant to the President.  Under my 
direction,  Jeff will perform many of the tasks of a full-time 
president, given that I am involved in many other ISG activities.  
Jeff was most recently a member of the Strategic Task Force.  
Prior to that, he was a Tymshare Vice President, responsible for 
the Payment Services Company.








Alden Heintz will continue to report to me as President of 
McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company, the organization within 
the McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company that 
is doing all of our current business in this area.  Alden will be 
involved in deliberations on all major McDonnell Douglas Financial 
Transaction Systems Company issues, but his primary focus will be 
on the continued growth and profitability of our existing 
businesses.

We intend in the near future to have McDonnell Douglas Financial 
Transaction Systems Company fully operational, with an integrated 
organizational structure and multiple business lines.  In the 
meantime, please give your full support to David, John, Jeff and 
Alden, as they set out to shape ISG's future in the financial 
transaction systems marketplace.

Effective immediately, Dick Miskell, Director ISG Field 
Facilities, will report to me.  Dick formerly reported to 
Paul Wiedenmann, Corporate Vice President - ISG Finance.

The mission for the Field Facilities function, as set out in Ref 
(a), remains unchanged.  It includes a planned consolidation of 
selected field locations into shared ISG Business Centers.  A task 
force, headed by Dick Miskell, is developing a plan for 
implementing these centers at specific locations.  An Executive 
Steering Committee will review Task Team actions and recommend 
policy requirements.

Please give Dick your full support and cooperation.

Duuuh!  So that's what happened to my WF!  . . .  I guess I'm a creature of
habit, I'd forgotten all about NEEDWF!  Maybe I need a vacation.

Q:  Is there any problem with host 184 not having a SPOOL directory?  It
looks like they don't use SPOOL on that host, from what I've seen
tonight:  When I tried to TELECOPY to SPOOL:184, I got "no FD for
(SPOOL:184)."

Everybody, including 930 (but excluding 184 and the domestic 2020's) has
been given the new NODPRI.

SEE you tomorrow!

SUBJ:    SPOOL's node/printer map updated 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The file (SPOOL)NODPRI has been updated on all CEGI hosts, including 90
(except host 184, which does not have a SPOOL directory).  The update
was completed by 5 am, GMT, 25 Jun 85.  The association of node numbers
with printer locations is now consistent with the information currently
entered into the data base on host 8 by System's Resource Allocation.

The delay in responding to your request for this update was due to the
need to correct errors in the file and confirm the contained
information.  Procedures and policies are being established to effect
the updating on a monthly basis, so the current problem should not
re-occur.

I hope and believe that all is now correct.  If host 184 should have the
NODPRI file for SPOOL, please let me know where it should be.  If the
node to printer correspondence is in error, please let SRA and me know.

TO:    ISG MANAGEMENT LIST A-E INCL. MDAIS
 
FROM:  JOHN LORTS, DIRECTOR
       MATERIALS AND LOGISTICS, MDFSC
 
SUBJ:  ORGANIZATION OF MDFSC 
       MATERIAL AND LOGISTICS DIVISION
 
 
*****************************************************************
 
 
After  a 2 day meeting with the major logistics functions of  the 

three  Field Service organizations,  Microdata,  Computer Systems 
and Support (CSS),  and Tymnet,  an organizational structure  was 

identified.   The  structure utilizes the best talents within the 
organizations and will focus on combining assets to integrate the 

operations and at the same time be transparent to our customers.
 
The results will offer greater capability to improve our  support 

of  the  new  Field  Operations Division and  for  the  McDonnell 
Douglas customer.  We feel confident that our abilities, combined 

with the assets available will help make us successful in support 
of our company's customer service effort.
 
With  quality  in  the main focus and with  the  best  individual 

effort  by  our  employees,  we will make  a  major  contribution 
towards  the  Field Service Company not only meeting it's  goals, 

but  exceeding  them.   Good performance will breed  success  and 
allow opportunity for growth to individuals who contribute  their 

best.
 
The  new  organization  was effective June 17,  1985  and  is  as 

follows.
 
Quality Control - Manager - Larry Keniston
------------------------------------------
 
Larry has been the Quality Control Manager at CSS Agoura for five 

years.    Prior  to  that,  Larry  was  either  in  manufacturing 
supervision  or in quality control with Douglas Manufacturing  or 

North  American  for  about  30  years.    Larry  brings   needed 
experience  to  MDFSC in all areas of quality  control  including 

complete  knowledge  of quality control as specified by the  U.S. 
Government.
 
Larry  will  relocate  to  the Field  Service  Depot  at  Irvine, 

California,  after the Agoura facility is relocated.  This should 
be  some  time in September of 1985.   As manager of our  quality 

control operations,  Larry will be responsible for inspection  of 
repair  and refurb work done in our depots.   Larry will  install 

procedures,  guidelines  and  systems that will  standardize  our 

Quality  Control  operations  at the existing depots in  King  of 
Prussia, Atlanta, Irvine, Fremont, and Chatsworth.
 
Please refer quality problems or questions to Larry.   Larry will 

be  working closely with the Material Support,  Test  Engineering 
and  Depot  Repair functions in our division to  deliver  quality 

spare parts.
 
Test Engineering - Manager - George Turner
------------------------------------------
 
George  has  been  the  Manager of Repair  and  Test  Support  at 

Microdata's  Field Service Depot  in  Irvine,  California,  since 
1979.   Prior to that,  George had a long career with the Navy in 

electronics  and  testing.   George  specializes  in  electronics 
testing  and automatic test engineering (ATE),  his strengths are 

in  the  use of analytical methods to define  problems  and  find 
solutions.
 
Under  George's  direction,  ATE standards and problems  will  be 

developed   and   ATE  hardware  will  be  deployed  to   enhance 
productivity and quality of repair in the repair depots.  Failure 

analysis will be a key responsibility to establish priorities  in 
attacking  failures in hardware serviced by our Field  Operations 

Divison.
 
Material Support - Director - Jerry Bowman
------------------------------------------
 
Jerry has been the Director of Logistics Operations at  Microdata 

since  1982.   Prior  to  that,  Jerry put together 22  years  of 
professional experience in logistics.  Jerry has spent 9 years in 

administration  and  management and 13 years  in  supervision  of 
various  logistics operations.   Jerry was previously employed by 

Tymshare  for  5  plus years and is familiar  with  the  Tymshare 
business and products prior to McDonnell Douglas.   Jerry will be 

responsible for integrating the material support functions of the 
three former organizations and their various  locations.   Please 

refer  any  material supply questions or needs to Jerry.   I  can 
assure you that Jerry will be more than happy to respond  quickly 

in the most professional manner as he has in support of Microdata.  
 
Depot Repair - Director - Virginia Buhr
---------------------------------------
 
Virginia  has  been the Director of Microdata's repair depots  in 

Irvine,  California,  and Atlanta,  Georgia.   Virginia has  been 
employed  by  Microdata  since 1976 and has  been  a  significant 

factor  in  the  high quality and quantity of parts  supplied  in 
support  of  the field operations  activity.   Virginia  will  be 

responsible  for  integrating  the  repair depots  of  the  three 
organizations along with their various locations.   In the  event 

that  McDonnell Douglas ventures into any 3rd Party Depot Repair, 
Virginia  will also support that activity.   I am sure all of  us 

are  looking  forward  to working with Virginia  and  her  proven 

ability to organize and work effectively with  people.   Virginia 
brings  20  plus  years of logistics support  experience  to  our 

division  which  provides a valuable source to draw from for  the 
challenges ahead.
 
Material and Logistics Planning - Manager - Anver Meghji
--------------------------------------------------------
 
Anver  has  been the Manager of Worldwide Parts for Tymnet  Field 

Engineering  and was first employed by Tymshare in  1973.   Anver 
has a successful track record in project management, implementing 

such projects as Dialnet,  Bofanet and Marsplus along with  video 
banking  development.   Anver  resides in the Bay Area  and  will 

remain here for the near term.  The first priority for Anver will 
be  to play the major role for our divison in project  monitoring 

and  system specification for the management systems that will be 
used  for our logistics efforts.   This is a major  effort  since 

none   of   the  three  organizations  have  systems   that   are 
integrateable.  Anver's business background and education will be 

a   great   asset  in  the  management  system  development   and 
implementation.
 
Chatsworth Depot - Manager - Jay Webb
-------------------------------------
 
Jay  Webb  has agreed to manage the depot and inventory  for  the 

Chatsworth,  California operations.   Jay has been involved  with 
management  of  the Chatsworth operation for over 10  years.   We 

intend to keep this operation separated from other operations  at 
this  time  as  it is a 3rd Party Service Depot for  very  mature 

Ampex and CalComp products.   Inventory sales and remanufacturing 
are  the  main focus of business with 50% of sales  to  the  U.S. 

Government  and 50% to the commercial markets.   The sales effort 
will remain with our sales division.   Jay will work closely with 

Sales to meet all delivery dates.  
 
I am sure that all of you,  like myself,  are looking forward  to 

the  integration  of the different organizations and the  various 
synergies.   There are great opportunities ahead for our division 

in  support of the various business units.   We feel we have  the 
ability  and  capacity to keep pace with  the  various  marketing 

efforts and support the Field Service needs of our customer base.  
The  combining of the different organizations make us one of  the 

largest field service organizations in operation.   A major focus 
is now upon us and we welcome the challenge.

     Subject:      ISG EXECUTIVE BOARD DECISION ON THE FIELD 
                   FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM




     The Executive Board has approved moving forward with Phase I of 
     the recommended plan for consolidation of selected field office 
     locations into shared ISG Business Centers.

     The initial metropolitan areas to be addressed in the plan 
     include New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., San 
     Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Houston and Dallas.  These eight 
     areas represent over 50% of the annual ISG real estate lease 
     expense and personnel in field locations.

     A task force of real estate management representatives from five 
     ISG business organizations will team with Dick Miskell, Director 
     - ISG Field Facilities, to develop a specified detailed 
     implementation plan and schedule for each metropolitan area.  
     The actual consolidation process will be implemented over a 
     three year period and will involve other metropolitan areas.

     An executive level Steering Committee comprised of 
     representatives from six ISG organizations will be utilized to 
     review and recommend policy needs.  These policy recommendations 
     will support the implementation and remote office administration 
     needs of the shared ISG Business Centers.  Specific areas to be 
     addressed include the remote office administrative organization 
     structures, office standards and the tenant cost allocation 
     process for real estate lease expenses as well as common office 
     services and equipment in the shared environment.

     These new ISG Business Centers will increase McDonnell Douglas 
     visibility in the ISG major market places, optimize office 
     services through the larger shared office environment and obtain 
     maximum leverage in lease negotiations to reduce long-term real 
     estate lease expense.  Please give your support to the task 
     force over the next few months to expedite completion of this 
     task assignment by the Executive Board.

     Phase One of the renovation of the Executive Briefing Center 
     will be completed on July 10, 1985.  Construction will be moved 
     to the far end of the hall opposite the library allowing guest 
     events to proceed without the congestion of the last two months.

     Make an appointment for a tour before you plan to use the new 
     facility.  Some new features of the Executive Briefing Center 
     include indicator lights to signal when your refreshments are 
     ready, a new projection room equipped for 35MM slides and 
     movies, fixed and portable video projection systems, and 
     electronically controlled room lights, screens, and projectors.  
     We suggest you stop by for a briefing before your meeting 
     begins.

     For reservations in the new facility, call Ann Duenke at 
     (314) 233-5196 and tell her what type of meeting you will be 
     having.  We'll need to know how many people, A/V requirements, 
     demonstration  needs (if any), and whether it's a workshop, 
     presentation or training class.  We'll assign you a room 
     designed to meet your needs.

     The Executive Briefing Center staff is prepared to assist all 
     field marketing personnel with the preparations necessary to 
     make your next visit a marketing event.  Allow us to assist with 
     your plans for local transportation, lodging, and meeting 
     services.

     Guest Dining reopened on June 24, 1985 in a beautiful new 
     facility designed for breakfasts, lunches, receptions and 
     dinners for our guests.  It now has a warm atmosphere conducive 
     to business discussions.  Operating procedures have remained as 
     they were prior to renovation.

     We are open for business again and we look forward to seeing you 
     soon.

I came in at 8:30 Sunday night when I could not get any response when
trying to LOGIN to 930.  I found APA0 hung, and the LA36 had worn a hole
in the paper repeated outputing "Unit APA0 Hung".  The hardware needs to
be fixed, the error-recovery software needs to be fixed.

Joe:
Do you have any experience with DECnet installations?
Steve Casper from our University of New Hampshire office has
installed "DMR's" on two systems but cannot get the software
to talk across the connecting line.  Do you have any advice
and if so would you call Steve at (603) 862-2323 to give hime
a hand.

Subject: Monitor changes 

Joe,
  I'd like you to put together a PCOM command file, whether it be done with
some sort of TECO macro or what... but something that will produce a set of
output files *.SCM or *.DIF (or something unique?) which can then be filed
with the transmittal or the MEM file to show all the changes made to all the
source files.
  I'd like to see an INCREMENTAL differences... such that

    COMMON.MAC <= COMMON.N13 <= COMMON.N12 <= COMMON.N11 <= COMMON.N06
    CORE1.MAC  <= CORE1.N12  <= CORE1.N10
    ONCE.MAC   <= ONCE.N12   <= ONCE.N02

We see for each module, differencs from the .N00 released monitor to present:

    COMMON.DIF <= {{.N00,.N06 + .N06,.N11 + .N11,.N12 + .N12,.N13 + .N13,.MAC}}
    CORE1.DIF  <= {{.N00,.N10 + .N10,.N12 + .N12,.MAC}}
    ONCE.DIF   <= {{.N00,.N02 + .N02,.N12 + .N12,.MAC}}

Maybe produce a single file... (N to P)
    P034NP.DIF <= {{ COMMON.DIF + CORE1.DIF + ONCE.DIF + ... }}

At least think about it.  Because we need some sort of control over the
changes after they've been done, as a review to insure thaat we have not
added any problems by mis-typing anything.

Many reorganizational changes are continuing within MDC,
as you all are aware - (what are you called THIS week??)  

Due to 'continuing', as of today, July 8, a freeze has been
placed on all renames or consolidations of accounts.  This
should last until around September 1.  I'll keep you posted
if there is any modification to this date.  

Thanks for your ongoing support.

Pictures for McDonnell Douglas Badges are in the process of
being taken.  Each division will be notified the day before.

For best results it is good to wear color.  Pictures only
take a few moments of your time so when it comes your time
please be available.  Anyone that is out the specific day
of their divisions pictures due to illness or vacation is
requested to let the Security Dept. know when they are back.

All pictures for VG1-2-3 will be taken in the Cafeteria of
VG1.  All other locations will be notified at a later date.

Following is an updated listing of the phone numbers for 2450 N. 1st.
 
WE STILL DO NOT HAVE DIRECT DIAL ACCESS.
 
You must use a tieline to call direct to an extension or call the main
number (435-0200) and ask the receptionist to put your call through.
Attempting to dial direct on an outside line will only give you a busy
signal.
 
This updated list includes the current phone listing for DSC personnel
with offices in this building.
 
Thank you,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------








To  reflect the reorganization of the old McAuto Company, several new
Ontyme  Accounts  have been created and the MCAUTO Account has become
obsolete.  Four of the newest Ontyme Accounts are --

           ISGFM -- ISG Fiscal Management Division
           ISGHQ -- ISG Executive Management
           ISGHR -- ISG Human Resources Division
           MDAIS -- McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Information Systems

I  have  included  the  latest  Directories for these Ontyme Accounts
here.    If you have any questions or need assistance, please call me
at  (314) 233-5116, the ISG USC (User Support Center) or ONTYME me at
ISGFM.K/WADDELL.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
With the excessive amount of update requests that flow through my
office everyday, there has come a need for me to select a designated
day that all requests will be completed.

Starting next week 7/15/85 all requests* for public updates will
be completed on Monday afternoons.  This means if I receive your
request on Tuesday morning, there will be a maximum of five(5) working
days before the update will be available.  If, by some miracle I
can complete the request before Monday afternoon, it will be given
my full attention.  Please, don't expect this to be completed before
Monday.  But, as I said before ... Miracles do happen!

If you will need (emergencies) the update before Monday. It would be
most appreciated if you would call the day before:

With, 1) Letting me know it's on it's way.  and 2) The day you will
need it by.

This memo does not pertain to the updates I have in my office as of
today 7/9/85.  These requests will be completed by Friday, 7/12/85.

Thank you for all your support in the past and future.  


Now on with the showwwwwwwww.......!!

* Exception:  Emergency updates are not included in this statement.

Chicago's recent ACS Seminar was a success, thanks to Jeff Lauer.
Jeff invited 14 attendees and identified four good prospects.
 
The schedule at press time is
 
          DATE             CITY             MANAGER
 
          August 22        Toronto          Phil Taylor

          September 17     Mountain View    Nick Chrimes
 
ACS Seminar coordinator Nancy Browning is exploring new ways of
helping the branches organize seminars.  She has asked other ISG sales
groups (for example, Manufacturing, MDCIS, and Banking) to invite
customers.
 
 
 . . . . . . . . . A NEW ACS STRATEGIC PLANNING GROUP . . . . . . . . .
 
Strategic Marketing Development (SMD), managed by Kathy Donigan, is an
exciting addition to ACS.  Kathy and key marketing and technical
people plan to suggest four to six new ACS products and services by
the end of the year.
 
"This year SMD plans to package capabilities that we are currently
using," reports Kathy.  "This means defining each product and its
customer base and preparing sales brochures and pricing schemes."
 
Kathy's SMD team identified two product sources:  TYMNET-based
products used by ACS clients, and successful integrated applications.
These integrated applications would be generalized from a particular
client to an entire industry.  The SMD team also pinpointed some
additional technologies needed by ACS development and will propose a
long-term plan.
 
Kathleen Farley, Lynne Edwards, Thomas Olt, and Bruce Watkins have
been appointed as SMD Product Managers.  Their first job is to develop
preliminary business plans for proposed products, and to determine
staffing needs.
 
 
 . . . . . . . . . . CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER NEWS . . . . . . . . . .
 
In early August, the Customer Service Center (CSC) will handle ACS
customer validations on the TYMCOM-370 and TYMCOM-X.  (Watch OnTyme
for details.)  CSC needs information for all customers entered into
the CSC customer profile data base by then.

Note to ACs and RCMs:  Please send your customer information to
CSC.HOTLINE.
 
CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER HOURS . . . .
 
The CSC is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific time.  Contact CSC at

Mainframe Product Support now supports mainframe AND micro products
and has a new name:  ACS Product Support.  This group now supports ACS
consultants, and CSC, and installs software, handles vendor relations,
and evaluates potential new software products.  ACS Product Support
personnel and their areas of responsiblity are:
 
    Terry Griffin           Manager
    Ron Bates               Micro products
    Dan Wedge               TYMCOM-370 and TYMCOM-X operating systems,

Terry's organization will release the following new versions of
software in July:  FOCUS (5.3), EXPRESS (90), and TELL-A-GRAF (5.0).
Watch OnTyme for details.

VALLEY FORGE DATA CENTER CLOSES . . . .
 
The Valley Forge Data Center recently closed, and ACS customers were
transferred onto two new IBM 3083s in Dallas.  "The 3083 is a more
cost-effective machine than the 3033 [which Valley Forge had], and has
a processing speed that provides almost twice the throughput," says
Terry.  "Everything that worked on the smaller machine works on the
3083, so the transfer is transparent to our customers."  The transfer
should result in over half a million dollars in savings for ISG this

Cupertino now joins St. Louis and Cypress, CA in offering
teleconferencing facilities.  We have a satellite dish.  The
teleconferencing center is ideal for 6 to 10 participants who want to
communicate long distance with another teleconferencing center,
explains Training Services Manager Carlota Santa Cruz.  Each center
can transmit audio, video, slides, overheads, and hard copy.  Training
Services first wants to try out the facility in non-critical
situations and then use it for small classes.  If you are interested

 . . . . . . . JULY PROFILE:  INTEGRATED SYSTEMS MARKETING . . . . . . .
 
Integrated Systems Marketing (ISM), promotes communications-based
systems that utilize multiple technologies.  It also offers mainframe
and micro-based tools for creating these systems.  Manager Scott
Holiman describes ISM's mandate:  ISM is to "make ACS the clear leader
in the delivery of integrated systems.
 
"There is a tremendous market for integrated systems," says Holiman.
"Our competitors are moving in this direction in a big way.  We have
the lead, but we must take advantage of our window of opportunity.
Our organization wants to support the sales force in exploiting that
lead."
 
ISM helps the branches identify new customers and develop sales
strategies.  It educates sales reps about integrated systems and
provides them with sales aids.  ISM also manages the ACS Customer
Service Center (CSC).
 
ACTIVITIES . . . .
 
The major ISM activity currently is The ACS Seminar, which explains to
potential customers the concept of integrated systems and describes
the successful Computerland application.  For more information on
seminar locations, times, invitations, and support, contact
ACS.N/BROWNING.
 
Other activities in the works include the release of a new version of
Tym/COMM in mid-September and brochures, data sheets, success stories,
and a sales kit.  If anyone knows of an integrated system that would
make a good success story, send an OnTyme to ACS.N/BROWNING.

15 July 1985
 
To:    MDC Employees Who Were Formerly Tymshare Employees
 
From:  C. H. Ridings
 
 
McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) has for many years 
supported charitable and community service activities 
through the MDC Employee Charity & Community Services (ECCS) 
program.  The primary source of the funds for the MDC ECCS 
program has been MDC employee contributions.
 
In the near future MDC employees who were formerly Tymshare 
employees will be contacted regarding their individual 
participation in the MDC ECCS program.  MDC ECCS uses 
employee contributions to support charitable and community 
services in the employee's local geographic area.
 
An example of local support is the following letter that I 
recently sent along with an MDC ECCS $1,000 contribution to 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Santa Clara County, 
Santa Clara, California:
 
     Ms. Nancy J. Wolff
     National Multiple Sclerosis Society
     Santa Clara County Chapter
     1765 Scott Boulevard, Suite 101
     Santa Clara, California 95050
 
     Dear Ms. Wolff:
 
     Pursuant to our telephone conversation of today, 
     McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) is pleased to 
     enclose MDC's Employee Charity & Community Services 
     check number 207302 totalling $l,000.
 
     The enclosed check is a contribution to the operating 
     funds of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Santa 
     Clara County, Santa Clara, California.  Please use the 
     contribution to continue the fine work your organiza
     tion is doing on a local and national basis.
 
     Please contact me at (408) 446-6405 if you have any 
     questions regarding the above.
 
 
Please be generous with your contributions when you are 
contacted for participation in the MDC ECCS program.

SUBJECT:  Fixed Asset Policies and Procedures
 
 
Following  is  a  brief summary of current Fixed  Asset  policies  and 
procedures  for McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems (headed 
by  Warren Prince) and specifically those locations whose  assets  are 
tracked  in  Cupertino,  CA.   Detail information can be found in  the 
Tymshare Policies and Procedures manual,  of which all managers should 
have a copy.   Current policies and procedures are being reviewed, and 
updated  versions will be released during the third quarter.   If  you 
have any questions, feel free to call me at (408) 446-6516.
 
1.   Capitalization Policy
 
     A.   The  requestor must complete the standard  Requisition  form 
          and the Authorization for Capital Expenditure (AFCE) for any 
          capital  item  of $1000 or more having a useful life  of  at 
          least  one  year.   This is an increase from the $400  limit

          possible price.  You can also contact her if you are in need 
          of a particular piece of equipment.

6.   Tagging New Assets

          order  or requisition to make sure that the items have  been 
          approved as capital equipment.
 
     C.   Upon receipt,  place a tag on the equipment and fill out the 
          Asset  Control  Log.   The  Asset  Control  Logs  should  be 
          submitted  on  a  monthly  basis  to  Peggy  Bollinger   at:

------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
 
A number of changes to payroll input and personnel record keeping 
will be necessitated by the implementation of the ISG Benefit 
Plans on September 30, l985.  Some of these changes are:
 
   .  New payroll attendance reporting system utilizing new
      format of absence reporting for all employees.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' scheduled shift.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' schedule work
      week.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' scheduled hours.
      Note:  ISG full benefit eligibility is based on full time
      status (40 hrs/week).  Partial benefit eligibility is based 
      on part-time scheduled to work 20 - but less than
      40 hrs/wk.  Employees scheduled to work less than
      20 hrs/week are not eligible.
 
   .  Check stub will indicate the balance of vacation days
      remaining.
 
   .  There will be no borrowed vacation days under the ISG
      Benefit Plan.
 
Due to the above changes during the week of September 23, all 
managers will need to submit the following information for each 
of their employees via a prompt program:
 
  1)  Scheduled Shift
 
  2)  Scheduled Work Week
 
  3)  Scheduled Hours Per Week
 
  4)  Number of Vacation Days earned in 1985 which have been

I am pleased to announce the appointment of Dennis M. Carvalho 
to the position of Director - Human Resources - ISG St. Louis 
Region, effective 5 August 1985.  Dennis will be reporting 
directly to me, with coordination through Mike Becker, Staff 
Vice President - Human Resources - ISG.

Dennis has served as Manager - Human Resources for the McDonnell 
Douglas Microelectronics Center since January 1984.  From 1977 
to 1984, he held increasingly responsible positions in a variety 
of Human Resources disciplines at Douglas Aircraft Company in 
Long Beach.  He brings to us significant experience in the areas 
of personnel administration, labor relations, EEO/AAP, wage and 
salary administration and employee benefits.

In 1977 he was conferred with a Masters in Labor and Industrial 
Relations from Michigan State University.  A native of Maui, 
Hawaii, Dennis lives in St. Charles, Missouri with his wife, 
Charlotte, and son, Jason.

For the near future, he and Mike Becker will work together 
closely to formulate the St. Louis Regional staff and its 
responsibilities.  Additional announcements will be made 
concerning this as soon as practical.

Please join me in welcoming Dennis Carvalho to the ISG Human 
Resources staff and offer him your support in his new role.

SUBJECT:  ISG BENEFITS PACKAGE



1.  Distribution of the new ISG Benefits summary plan 
    descriptions is scheduled for Saturday, July 27, 1985.  As 
    managers you will receive the first packets.  This advance 
    copy will allow you to review the material prior to the 
    general employee mailing.

2.  Original plans called for you to receive your packets one 
    week prior to the mass distribution.  Due to printing delays 
    and the need to hold to the implementation date of 
    September 30, 1985, there will only be a two day difference 
    between packets mailed to management and those mailed to the 
    balance of employees.

3.  Enrollment meetings are scheduled at major business unit 
    locations throughout August.  A schedule of meeting dates 
    and sites is included with the packet.  Your support of 
    these enrollment sessions is critical to the success of the 
    program.

4.  Specific questions about the enrollment procedure or 
    benefits booklets can be referred to Karen Welch 
    (714) 250-1000 or Joe Hoffman (314) 232-8488.

told it to forward the message to 930 when it came up.  Appearantly it did
not get through.

I worked at home Thursday.  Someone needed to be around when the exterminators
arrived (my wife was out).  The remainder of the day was spent waiting in line
at the DMV getting my car registered with the state of California.  Currently
I am still going through the TOPS-10 version of Ralph Gorin's book to make sure
the examples will work with TYMCOM-X.

Sorry about the message mix-up, next time I will follow up with a phone call.

Carl,

I prefer that you come in to work rather than working at home
unless there is a pressing reason for you to stay home.
You may be interrupted at work, but that is because people
need to talk to you.

Since I needed to drive to Santa Clara at noon for the doctor's appt. it
seemed a bit much to waste an additional hour driving back to Fremont at
2:00 to be available for 3 whole hours for consultation, (when I could
be just as available by phone, and NOT waste the hour in traffic).  If
this is a real problem, please let me know.  [I realize that I gave no
explanation for WHY I was working at home until now].

Sorry for the oversight.  Will be in as usual, tomorrow.

Subject: Operating System PACKAGEs: (SPL) & (MPL) Software 

Craig,

   Carl recommends that programs currently in the SPL directory (System
software section Program Library) and the MPL directory (Monitor unit
Program Library) be packaged as a separate set of packages.  After
discussion with him I see his point.  I'd like to discuss this with you;
we are currently packaging some of these 'subsidiary operating system-
related utilities' with more intrinsically operating system-related
software.

thanks,
Dennis

In an attempt to clean up and organize things... M33 is being *split* into
two separate directories.  The monitor and things like MONED will remain
in directory (m33).. {includes MDDT,SYMAUX,???DDT,etc.}
  Things which are monitor utilities such as LOGINN,LOGOUT,TAKEIT,etc. are
all moved to directory (OSU).  This is an evolutionary project and will
take a little time for the dust to settle... so, please be patient...

  **** IF YOU HAVE (M33) IN YOU "DO-LIST", PLEASE BEWARE ****
	*** you might just add OSU to your list? ***
	*** This affects things with special-command-mode!!! ***

After some searching... I found the problems with KL halted, JSP!
Joe modified the sources to cover this and rebuilt the monitors
with CPUS.CTL.  I ran MONED1 to update things to /N24 ...

I updated both the running monitors and (SYS)NEWMON on 35, 36, 39 & 55
to reflect the changes [/N23-1] of PUSHJ P,SAVE4 ==> JSP T4,SAVE4 at
REDSBC+1 and a POPJ P, at CVPPC both in ERRCON.

The test, using S$INFO,,CPOPJ1 did not seem to work completely since it
still caused the system to go to boots.  CUPC OPS is inter-office mailing
the CTY output to me.

Subject: STOPCDs don't continue if the base gets impatient. 

We got the CTY output from C36 from when Carl was testing INFO stopcodes
on the KL.  With the latest patch, the stopcode is output correctly, and
the system continues, but at the next clock tick it notices that nonzero
has been deposited in 30, and reloads the monitor.  In the first test,
30 contained 000404,,003337 and in the second test it contains 001070,,002177.

It appears that the base got upset that KEY620 was not being updated while
the stopcode information was being output.

The long-term solution is to tell the new base code that the PDP-10 is
experiencing a stopcode, and that it should not expect KEY620 to be updated
for 90 seconds.  A short-term hack would be to modify the routine that
outputs to the CTY and have it update KEY620 while waiting to send the
next character.

Subject: INFO stopcodes 

Hmmmm.  Seems we should put in the code that we discussed:
  If it is NOT a stopcode which is going to take the system down... this
includes JOB,INFO and EVENT stopcodes ...then we setup code which duplicates
the ITMINT code and we make sure that the key continues to be refreshed.
This means "possibly" saving the contents of the key...and restoring it,
but I think we don't need to do that.

1. This memo is a follow-up to the July 22 memo from Joe Walton, in
   which several ISG Benefit topics were introduced.
 
   * Scheduled Shift
     The PPSII (Payroll Personnel System) will require assigned shift
     for all employees in order to insure correct payment of shift    
     premium. The data collection system mentioned in the first memo
     will collect the assigned shift of all ISG Tymshare employees as
     of 09/30/85.  This will be done from 09/24 thru 09/27.
 
     After the benefit conversion (09/30/85) changes to assigned shift
     for more than 5 consecutive days must be reported to Cupertino
     Human Resources no later than the week in which the employee 
     changes shift, in order to assure accurate attendance processing.   
     Changes to assigned shift of less than 5 consecutive work days do 
     not require a change to the personnel system. 
 
 
   * Scheduled Work Week
     For proper attendance and absence reporting, a correct record of
     an employee's work week (scheduled days off) will be carried in the 
     PPSII system.  The general data collection (09/24 thru 09/27) will
     supply PPSII with the correct work week for each  employee as of 
     09/30/85. Thereafter changes to this assigned work week will need
     to be reported to Cupertino HR for update.
 
                                                                Page  2

   * Scheduled Working Hours
     For Part Time employees, an accurate record of work schedule will 
     be critical. Benefit eligibility will be determined based on
     scheduled hours per week.
 
   * Vacation records will be maintained in PPSII begining 09/30/85.
     This will require the number of vacation days taken by each 
     employee in 1985.  The amount of vacation accrued in 1985 (Jan.01
     thru Sept 30) will be calculated based on service date.  The 
     number of vacation days taken will be deducted from the 1985
     accrued time.  The figure that management will be asked to supply
     is the number of  vacation days each employee has taken in 1985 
     (Jan thru Sept) which were earned in 85.  Any vacation days taken
     against time earned in 1984 are not to be included.
 
   * No Borrowed Vacations
     The ISG vacation policy requires that vacation time be earned,  
     prior to being taken.  It is possible that under the present 
     Tymshare practice that by 09/30 an employee may have taken more
     days than have been earned to date, resulting in a negative value.
     This value will then be balanced out as an employee accrues  
     additional vacation days.
 
   * The procedures for vacation advances will be covered in a seperate
     memo.
 
2. In order to assist in the collection of the above information, you
   will be given a worksheet via the attendance system by Sept 6 with
   the names of all the employees assigned to your area.  This listing 
   will have space to fill in the requested data and can be used as an
   input sheet Sept 24 - 27, when inputing to the collection system.
 
3. Please direct your questions to the author via Ontyme to HRD.TOSH.

 . . . . . . . . AUGUST PROFILE:  MARKETING SERVICES . . . . . . . . .
 
ACS Marketing Services consists of five units managed by Shirley
Macemon that work together to provide the sales support materials
necessary to sell ACS products and services.  These units are
responsible for:
 
* Product documentation (user's guides, reference manuals, and
  primers)
* Marketing support materials (brochures, data sheets, and various
  other sales aids)
* Sales and customer training materials
* Public relations and advertising
* Market research for product managers
* Building administration in VG-3.
 
During the past year, Shirley has worked with her section managers to
 
* Develop a better understanding of what training and support
  materials we can provide the sales force to help sell ACS products
* Develop effective public relations and advertising campaigns and
  materials, and marketing support materials such as data sheets,
  sales lists, and slide presentations
* Assign an "Opportunity Coordinator" to each product manager who
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 2
 
  requests Marketing Services' support.  The opportunity coordinator's
  responsibility is to monitor all aspects of the product manager's
  projects to ensure timely and high quality support.
* Create training, promotional, and technical materials "better,
  faster, cheaper"

Marketing Promotions.  Watch the September NEWSFLASH for information
on Training Services and Course Developments, Market Research, and
Administration.
 
MARKETING PUBLICATIONS . . . .
 
Marketing Publications produces a wide variety of written materials
for ACS.  According to Larry Tolbert, Marketing Publications Manager,
the group's task is to "make ACS products easier to understand and
use, and to assist in image-making and sales support for these
products."
 
Marketing Publications no longer produces only technical and training
manuals.  The group has taken an exciting new direction and now
provides a wide range of promotional materials, such as data sheets,
success stories, advertising copy, and scripted slide shows for sales
presentations.
 
For example, Marketing Publications recently completed six OnTyme
technical publications, ten data sheets, a case study for Forbes
magazine, and support materials for the ACS Seminar.  In September
they will release the Tym/COMM User's Guide, and in October three
stories for the ACS Success Story series.  They wrote Tym/COMM and ACS
Seminar ad copy for ISM.  And, they are working closely with Bill
Sarnoff to develop the ACS company brochure.
 
For a detailed list of publications produced by Marketing
Publications, see OnTyme Publications and ISM Publications in this
NEWSFLASH.  Or consult the OnTyme file *** ACS.PUBLICATIONS.

PRODUCTION SERVICES . . . .
 
Production Services, a subunit of Marketing Publications, provides
editing services, coordinates printing and production, and ensures
that ACS printed materials project a highly professional image to
customers and to other MDC groups.  Production Services supervisor Bob
Raymond joined the group on August 5.  He is a former Tymshare
employee and brings years of production expertise and knowledge back
to ACS.

MARKETING PROMOTIONS . . . .
 
Marketing Promotions Specialist Bill Sarnoff coordinates all
promotional activities for ACS.  Bill works closely with other
Marketing Services units to ensure that ACS publications project a
uniform image.  He also coordinates our advertising and public
relations activities.  He is currently working with the PR firm of
Dudly-Anderson-Yutzy (DAY) to present ACS products, services, and key
personalities to the business community through the trade press.  For
example, Bill is coordinating Phil Marson's upcoming PR tour.  He is

Subject: Future dates! 

Osman got a complaint from MARCONI about a file in his directory which
had a date sometime in the future.  It was one of the MAGNRN.SHR files
probably copied or restored from tape into (MARCONIT).  Osman wanted
to know if we could explain how the date got set to the future...

Well,  the ENTER & CHANIO .CHENT calls both check the date value and
set it to today's date [THSDAT] if it is in the future.

But,  both RENAME (probably .CHREN too) and UPDATE-ENTER don't seem
to care at all.  We were able to set the date to any date we please
past or present WITHOUT ANY LICENSE.

This isn't really a problem, but unless someone knows of a good reason
why any file UUO can set the date/time field of a file to the future,
I vote that we should put the appropriate checks in the appropriate
places and stop this fiction before anyone else complains.

Subject: 14-bit node numbers 

Yes, I said 14-bit node numbers.  TYMNET NTD is looking at expanding the
current 12-bit numbers since they are currently at '7200+ and will soon
overflow the 12-bit field.

Gazel Tan has asked me to help identify potential software problems on
the PDP-10s if they were to go to 14-bit node numbers.  In the monitor,
the problem is minimal, we have a few extra bits and could easily make
room for up to 16-bit fields.

Various utility programs would falter badly, not to mention SPOOL, which
has relied on 11-bit node numbers and is already needing a fix.

I'd like you to examine the PDP-10 utilities and possibly applications
which do anything with node numbers and make a list: programs which key
off the node (eg. SPOOL,MAGNUM) and programs which simply report what is
read (eg. SYSTAT).

Once we have the list, we can determine what impact changing the node
numbers to 14-bits will have on our environment.

I took a call, checked out the files on MAGNUM,FTMAGNUM and copied my

I told them to contact Frank Siegel, or Dick Ouilette in the MAGNUM group

way to get ahold of the magnum people during the weekend.  If any of you

Subject: 12-bit node numbers 

Sigh... SYSTAT only reads up to node 3000!   That's why we see *6657* in
the systat listings.  FYI there are two places in SYSTAT that do a
  MOVEI M,3000   instruction then later CAMGE M,xxxxx to check the node
number.  I binary-patched (SYS:930)SYSTAT.SHR to  MOVEI M,7777  to test
it and "le voila" it now prints node names higher than 3000!

Oh, and since TYMNET may or may not have updated things... I wrote a
little program, DEFNOD which is in (TYMNET) that reads NODES.MAP and
does nice things to it.

It's basically DEFSYS/DEFPRI/DEFNOD hacked to work on the right file.
DEFSYS looks at (SYS)PERP.SYS,  DEFPRI looks at (SPOOL)NODPRI and now
DEFNOD looks at (TYMNET)NODES.MAP....

sigh... gee.. it's easy to write/modify programs which read binary files
and print out the entries, and modifies them... real easy... sigh...

Anyway... nodes should type out on 930 a little more sensibly now...
However, don't bother trying to transmit SYSTAT or anything like that
until we get the new 14-bit node standard implemented....

I've talked to Dave Smith, and since he was asked to co-ordinate with
me how to do the new standard, and the base gets it as a 16-bit word,
chances are that we will go to 2 8-bit bytes as I proposed the other
day.   (however, NOTHING will be done until the new bases are completely
deployed in the network and the varians are all gone!!!)

When the monitor changes to 16-bit node numbers, there should be a new bit in
the feature-test GETTAB table.  If the bit is off (or the GETTAB fails), then
LDBLOG has 12 bit numbers.  If the bit is on, then 16-bit numbers are in use.
I mention this now so that the programs can be modified before the change.

Subject: 912 modems vs power failures. 

The power flickered many times in Fremont north of Mowry several times last
night.  Each time the power came back on, the model 912 modem I have at home
went into autoanswer - it took the phone "off the hook".  This is usually not
too bad, execpt that it did not hang up after 30 seconds like it was supposed
to.  As a result, the line was kept busy and PAC BELL sent nasty warning tones
on the line.  The model 912 is the only modem I have seen to be untrustworthy,
and should be unplugged when the power is unsteady.

Subject: TYMSHARE's EDDT won't run on a KL with the MCA-25 upgrade. 

Any program that attempts to determine whether it is running on a KL versus
a KS by looking at the APRID (CPU serial number) won't work on KLs that have
the MCA-25 cache/pager upgrade.  For instance, EDDT does:

	APRID 17
	TRNE  17,10000
	JRST  KS

On the KL, bit 23 is one of the hardware options, it is set if the MCA-25
upgrade is installed.

The only reliable way to distinguish the two processors is to use the example
in the System Reference manual.  That is:

	MOVEI	2,777777	;High-order part of a 72-bit number
	SETZB	3,5		;Clear byte pointer, string is 0 bytes long
	MOVEI	4,1		;Set double length binary result
	EXTEND	1,[CVTBDO]	;Attempt to convert binary to decimal string
	TLNN	4,200000	;This bit is set by a deliberate bug in KL
	JRST	KS		;KS and later DEC processors do not set 200000

Subject: CEGI support, /N on system 443 

Peter Stratman has sent me mail indicating that they keep getting a
timeout from initia, and that initialization does not complete correctly.

I know that 2020's are NOT allowed to have CRSHID on (SYS) unless they
have the new initia (not available for 2020s at the moment).  However, I
do not think that this is their problem.

If we can check the BASE node number to see if they are running TYMNET-I
or TYMNET-II code, we may have an answer... or maybe not...

Joe, do you know what software you had to change on system 95 to get it
to do everything correctly?

Subject: USRFLT+3 really means "PC out of bounds", page 0 not in null job. 

If you do "START 147" and the processor was running the null job and you do
not reset the CPU first, the system will die at USRFLT+3=PFLLDC since the
processor is restarted in user mode, with the PC pointing to user page 0, and
the null job does not have the accessabile bit set for page zero.  It is
possible that all USRFLT+3 stopcodes occured as a result of the operator
trying to get to BOOTS by restarting at 147.  I say this because it occurs
fairly reliably on the KS, and for some of the dumps on D31, CRSHID reported
that the crash code was executed twice.  After P is out, we need to move the
test for page fault in the null job to a different location, earlier in the
code.  

The 147 restart only works if you reset the CPU so that it is in EXEC mode.
For the F3 and KI, both STOP and RESET must be toggled.  For the KS, the
command "KS10>SM" must be given to restart the microcode in EXEC mode.
(I'm not sure what is needed for the KL.)

     SUBJECT:      PROMOTION OF P. A. JELINSKI




     I am pleased to announce the promotion of Peter A. Jelinski to 
     the position of Director Business Management-Manufacturing and 
     Engineering Systems of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
     International (MDISI).  Peter will remain in The Hague and report 
     to me.

     He will have business management responsibility for international 
     sales of ISG manufacturing and engineering systems products.  
     Peter is well qualified for this position having had sales and 
     management experience in Europe since September 1982 when he 
     joined the Nordic office in Stockholm and then assumed 
     responsibility of General Manager for the Nordic operations in 
     February 1983.  In January 1984, he was promoted to European 
     Manager of CAD/CAM and moved to The Hague.

     Peter first joined MDC in July 1972 as a scientific programmer in 
     Huntington Beach.  He then joined Control Data Corporation in 
     January 1977 in Minneapolis where he was a unit manager for 
     software field support and later was promoted to senior 
     consultant for CDC computer systems marketing.  He rejoined 
     McAuto in June 1982 in St. Louis and moved to Stockholm in 
     September 1982.

     Born in London, Peter is an American citizen and attended schools 
     in Montreal and California.  He received a B.A. in mathematics 
     from California State University, Fullerton in 1971.  In 1972 he 
     was graduated with an M.S. in mathematics from the University of 
     London.

     Peter and his wife, Kerstin, are the parents of two children:  
     Rebecca, 2, and Christopher, who is 3 months old.  Peter attended 
     the ISG Marketing Achievement Club in 1984 in Jamaica.  He is a 
     member of the American Management Association.

     We are looking forward to receiving the benefits of Peter's 
     business management, insight and knowledge of planning and 
     contributing to the sales of ISG`s manufacturing, architectural, 
     engineering and construction products on an expanding scale 
     internationally in the near future.  Your cooperation with him in 
     achieving our greater goals will be greatly appreciated.

***************************** MEMORANDUM *****************************
 
    DATE:  AUGUST 16, 1985                                           
 
     TO:  ALL EMPLOYEES (PLEASE POST)
 
   FROM:  STEPHEN REYNOLDS, MANAGEMENT TRAINING
          AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MT&PD)
 
SUBJECT:  NEW COURSE OFFERING --- "COUNSELOR SELLING SKILLS"
          
---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
The Wilson Learning "Counselor Selling Skills" program, used 
extensively by the McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, is now 
available to all ISG employees. 
                                                                         
Counselor Selling is a CUSTOMER focused program, rather than being 
product-focused like the Xerox-based programs.  It teaches how to 
build relationships with potential customers and how to achieve a 
MUTUALLY AGREED UPON UNDERSTANDING of their situation PRIOR to 
discussing the features and benefits of one's product(s).  It focuses 
on creating a "win-win" environment where the prospect WANTS TO BUY, 
rather than trying to "sell" the prospect.  Participants receive pre- 
and post-course feedback from potential and actual customers of their 
choice.
 
The seminar will be conducted by Randy Lipson, trainer for Bob 
Donoghue, Inc.  Randy has 23 years of sales experience and is former 
PSS-II & III trainer.  Employees' cost centers will be charged $710 
for their participation in this four day seminar.  This seminar is 
scheduled for the following dates: 
 
                 Oct. 21-24                  San Jose

***************************** MEMORANDUM *****************************
 
     
   DATE:  AUGUST 19, 1985                                                  
                                                
     TO:  ALL EMPLOYEES (PLEASE POST)                       
 
   FROM:  STEPHEN REYNOLDS, MANAGEMENT TRAINING
          AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MT&PD)
 
SUBJECT:  MT&PD MANAGEMENT TRAINING SCHEDULE FOR THE REMAINDER 
          OF 1985.                                                     
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
Given current initiatives to reduce costs within the ISG, a number of 
questions have been raised about programs conducted by MT&PD.  The 
following summarizes the status of these programs.
 
     1. All "Phase" programs in St. Louis scheduled between August 19 
        and December 31, 1985 have been cancelled.  A full schedule
        of Phase seminars is planned for 1986;  allocations for 1986 
        Phase slots will be made early in 4Q85.
 
     2. All San Jose MHP seminars will be held as scheduled, allowing 
        all Bay Area managers and supervisors to be trained by
        December, 1985.  The September MHP for New York has been 
        postponed until 1Q86.
 
     3. All other MT&PD programs will be held as scheduled, so long as 
        minimum enrollment requirements are met.  (A complete
        schedule is available on ONTYME; type :READ *** MTPD.SCHED)
        Enrollment in any MT&PD seminar (which includes a cost 
        recovery charge-back) requires written approval of your
        manager.  In some divisions additional levels of approval may 
        be required prior to confirmation of enrollment.
                                          
If you have any questions about MT&PD programs, please contact us at
408/446-7813, HRD.TRNG (ONTYME), or VG2-A04 (inter-office mail).

Would you get together any and all stopcode documentation and actual

I can use them as ammunition when I see Bill Fisher.  I need the

MEMO
 
T-RJF-009
 
TO:       The World
 
FROM:     Asset Control
 
SUBJECT:  Physical Inventory of Fixed Assets
 
As  announced previously via Ontyme,  McDonnell Douglas  Business 
and  Network  Systems will be conducting a physical inventory  of 
fixed  assets on October 1,  1985.   This inventory will  involve 
only  those  locations  whose assets are  tracked  in  Cupertino, 
California.   These  locations have cost center  numbers  between 
2000  and 6000;  those cost centers falling outside this range or 
which have alpha-numeric designations such as L475, etc. will not 
be included in this inventory.     
 
The purpose of this inventory is to insure that all fixed  assets 
are   recorded  at  their  proper  locations,   and  to  allocate 
depreciation expense correctly.   We must rely upon the personnel 
at  each  location  to  give us  the  most  accurate  information 
possible.
 
Inventory  packets  will  be sent to contact  personnel  at  each 
location  by  September 20,  1985.   These packets  will  include 
complete inventory instructions,  as well as a Physical Inventory 
Report listing all assets which the Cupertino Fixed Asset  System 
shows as being held at your location.  Additional asset tags have 
already been sent to those who have requested them.
 
You  will  be asked to (a) verify whether you do or do  not  have 
each  item on the Physical Inventory Report;  (b) tag and  record 
those assets which have not already been tagged;  (c) give us any 
information you can for those assets shown which you do not have; 
and  (d)  tag  and record any assets you may have which  are  not 
shown  on  the report.   Completed inventory packets  are  to  be 
returned the day following the inventory to:
 
McDonnell Douglas ISG
Asset Control Department
VG1-B12
20705 Valley Green Drive
Cupertino, California  95014
 
Only MDC-owned assets are to be included in the inventory; do not 
tag  items  which are on lease or loan from outside the  company.  
Also, all company-owned equipment located at employees homes must 
be brought in to your office location for tagging and recording.
 
 
 
 
 
Items to be inventoried and tagged are as follows:
 
A.   All  computer  equipment - CPU's,   memory,  disk  and  tape 
     drives,  controllers,  processors,  line and laser printers,      
     etc.
 
B.   All personal computers (main units and printers).
 
C.   All terminal equipment.
 
D.   Modems (except those associated with engines, which will be 
     inventoried separately with the engines).
 
E.   Specific  office  equipment  - copy  machines,  tyewriters, 
     bursters, collators, microfiche printers, etc.
 
F.   Specific  test  equipment  - oscilloscopes,  volt  meters, 
     off-line testers, etc.
 
G.   Specific  furniture  - microwave   ovens,   refrigerators, 
     conference  tables,  etc.  (do not tag desks,  chairs,  file 
     cabinets, adding machines or other low-cost items).
 
Complete  lists of items to be or not to be tagged,  as  well  as 
instructions on tagging and recording assets, will be included in 
the instructions you will receive in your inventory packets.
 
If  you  do not receive your inventory packets by  September  20, 
1985,  or  if  you  have any questions regarding  the  inventory, 
please  contact  either Bob Forgione at (408) 446-6516  or  Peggy 
Bollinger at (408) 446-7760.   Also, if you have not already done 
so,   please  send  the  following  information  via  Ontyme   to 
FIN.FIXEDASSETS immediately:
 
(1)  Name and Ontyme I.D.  of person responsible for controlling 
     inventory procedures at your location;
(2)  Contact phone number;
(3)  Organization/Division name and cost center(s);
(4)  Full   address   for   shipment  of   tags   and   inventory 
     instructions;
(5)  Mailing  address  for  shipment  of  tags  and   inventory 
     instructions;
(6)  Estimated  number of tags needed for assets not  previously 
     tagged.

SUBJECT:  Budget Input Forms
 
 
For  those  of you who received budget input forms,  I'd like  to 
clarify some of the information presented.   The actual column on 
the  input sheets represents the year-to-date figure rather  than 
the  monthly  amount.   For  example,  the  March  actual  figure 
represents the actuals for January, February, and March.  It does 
not represent the actual just for the month of March.

Subject: 930 backups 


Since we are now without a COOP student to do the backups on system
930 we must have an alternative mechanism. After discussing with each
of you some suggested ways of handling the backups I am proposing
the following procedure in the interests of simplicity and reliability.
Each person in the list will have one day of the week assigned to
do incremental backups- this assignment will last "forever" and should
be easy to rememeber.  The monthly ALL FILES backup will rotate
across all memeb
across all members.

The winning assignments are:

Monday - Osman
Tuesday - Dan
Wednesday - Carl
Thursday - Joe
Friday - Bill

Monthly ALL FILES:

September - Dennis
October - Bill
November - Joe
December - Dan
January - Carl
February - Osman

See Osman if you have any questions about the procedure to follow.
Please do the incrementals at a regular time each day, say between
4 p.m. and 6 p.m.

If there are any problems with the assignments see me and we will
consider adjustments

Subject: EDDT vs MCA-25 

I fixed the version of EDDT in M33 to work with all KL-10s.  The monitor
built from OSP will work with the MCA-25, as long as you don't try to use EDDT.

To repeat: It is OK to use the CPU serial number to distinguish the KS from the
KL provided that you get the CPU serial number via GETTAB.  It is not OK to
use APRID to distinguish the two processors because APRID returns a bunch of
bits in addition to the CPU serial number.  For programs that run in EXEC mode
on all CPUs (such as EDDT), the only distinguishing feature is that the KL
returns different data on EXTEND[CVTBDO].

Subject: EDDT & P034/P 

The "jist" of the changes to EDDT are that P034/P, the monitor will run
on all processors, including processors with an MCA-25.  However, to use
EDDT on those systems with an MCA-25 you need to run the next version
of the monitor.
-Right?

TO:       ISG Employees

SUBJECT:  Charity Drive



These are tough times for all of us in ISG.  But, keeping it all 
in perspective, there are people in our communities who have it 
a lot tougher.

As you may know, McDonnell Douglas offers you an opportunity to 
help our less fortunate neighbors by means of two community 
services funds -- Employee Charity and Community Services (ECCS) 
and Personnel Community Services (PCS).  Your contribution to 
either fund is made through payroll deduction and the money 
stays within the community in which you live.  As a matter of 
fact, one in three of those who contribute will benefit directly 
from one of the many organizations supported by ECCS/PCS.

"I Care, I Share" is the theme of this year's ECCS/PCS 
me in mind when a company 
representative calls upon you.  Please show how much you care by 
sharing generously.

              VACATION SCHEDULING AND PAY ADVANCES
 
 
 
Effective September 30, l985, with the implementation of the ISG 
benefit package, earned vacation records for all ISG employees 
will be maintained in the MDC Payroll Personnel System (PPS II).
Once this is accomplished, advance pay for pre-scheduled vacations 
will be issued out of PPS II.
 
Requests for advance vacation pay will be as follows:
 
 1)  Vacation schedules are to be submitted via OnTyme message to 
     MDCHQ.PERSONNEL at least 2 weeks prior to the start of the
     vacation.
 
 2)  Requests should be made in the following format:
 
     Employee number, employee name (last, int.), first day of 
     vacation, number of vacation days
  
     Example:
 
     E.N.          NAME                   SCHEDULE 
 
     123456        Jones, J.          11/28/85 for 10 days
                                                                Page  2

 
 3)  For questions regarding vacation schedules and advances, call
     (314) 233-2974.
 
 4)  As a backup to the above OnTyme procedure, vacation schedules 
     can be called in to ISG Human Resources at (314) 232-7490.
 
 5)  It will be the responsibility of the office managers to 
     satisfy internal approvals before the schedule is transmitted 
     to PPS II for input.  This can be accomplished through the 
     use of MDC form #4006-2 which, when approved, would be 
     retained by department supervision.
 
 6)  Cancellations will be processed in the same manner.  Include 
     the same information along with the message "cancel 
     vacation".
 
 7)  Vacation advances will be made in 5 day increments only.
     NOTE: No vacation advance will be issued for schedules
           which include unearned and therefore borrowed days
           under the "Accelerated Vacation Policy". Vacations
           consisting partly or totaly of borrowed days will 
           not be pre-scheduled as outlined above rather they
           are to be reported throught the payroll attendance 
           system at the time the vacation is taken.
 
 8)  Vacation schedules for less than 5 days will not be advanced.  
     No schedule is to be reported to PPS II.  These days will be 
     reported through the weekly attendance collection system.
 
 9)  Vacation advance checks will be issued the Friday prior to 
     the first day of vacation.
 
10)  This procedure will become effective with vacations beginning
     on or after 10-14-85.  Approved vacation schedules for that 
     date or later should be submitted at your earliest       
     convenience to insure advance pay.
 
11)  Direct your questions to the writer via OnTyme HRD.TOSH.

1.  In addition to the information which you are being asked
    to supply Sept 24-26 regarding vacation days taken in 1985, 
    you will be asked to identify the number of days vacation
    taken between August 26 and September 29.  This information
    is needed to accurately comply with the requirements of the
    ISG Accelerated Vacation Policy.
 
2.  When logged into the Payroll Data Collection system September
    24, 25 or 26, you will first be prompted to input the number
    of vacation days taken in 1985 which were earned after
    January 1, 1985. (Vacation time taken against 1984 carryover is
    not to be included.)
 
3.  Next you will be asked to enter the number of vacation days 
    days taken since August 26, 1985 through September 29.  This
    number will be included in the total number entered above but
    needs to be recorded separately, in order to credit the five day
    vacation which a given employee may have taken prior to September
    30.  After September 29, vacation absences will be tracked in 
    PPS II.
 
4.  Contact the writer via Ontyme HRD.TOSH if you have any questions.

I am pleased to announce the formation of the Real Estate 
Management organization within the previously announced 
Information Systems Group Facilities staff operation.

This group level organization will administer and coordinate ISG 
real estate lease functions with the exception of Tymnet node 
only locations and continue to implement the Field Facilities 
Consolidation Program.  Disk Miskell, Director - ISG Real Estate 
Management is responsible for this activity reporting to me.

Effective 01 October 1985, this new organization will provide 
services for new lease requirements while existing real estate 
organizations in Irvine and Cupertino, California will continue 
to support existing lease and accounting activities with the 
data processing systems in place.  A migration plan is being 
formulated to transfer relevant real estate lease information to 
St. Louis.  This plan will be communicated in a later 
Administrative Bulletin.

Your support of this new organization in performing ISG real 
estate functions and the on-going Field Facilities Consolidation 
Program will be appreciated.

The OnTyme Account, CPC, Commercial Processing Center, will be 
renamed this Saturday, 9-14, to IPC, Information Processing 
Center.  What does this mean to you??  Please take special note 
of the following:
 
     *  The only change involved in this rename is a change in 
the account code, from CPC to IPC.  The usernames (after the 
period), will not alter.  For instance:
 
          Bev Martin, (also CPC.SUP), has a personal userid, 
          CPC.B/MARTIN.  Only her account code is changing, the 
          username remains the same.  Starting Monday, her new 
          userid is IPC.B/MARTIN.  All other CPC userids are 
          affected in the same manner.
          
     *  Withhold any messages you wish to send to any CPC users 
from Thursday 1700 PDT (9-12) until Sunday 1700 PDT (9-15).  Send 
these messages Monday (9-16) to the new IPC userid.
 
     *  If you have any distribution lists which currently 
include CPC userids, remember to change CPC to IPC.
 
     *  If you wish to verify a userid, read *** DIRECT.IPC for 
an entire listing of userids under IPC.

Due to Colman Jung's departure, LOGINN and OPER passwords have been

If you wish to know the new passwords, please ask me.  (I'm just
reluctant to put them in writing, in this memo.)

If any of you knows of an OPER password for usernames TSUCOOP or
SPPOPER, please let me know -- I believe they may have have existed, but
I don't know them.  Let me know them:  I'll make them consistent with
the LOGINN passwords.  This would be particularly valuable for username
SPPOPER, which often uses license.

The ACS Seminar is proving to be an effective way to guarantee ACS
leads.  St. Louis Diversified Sales representatives put together an
extensive prospect list with the assistance of ISM, mailed 300
invitations, did phone follow up on the majority of prospects,
confirmed 38 attendees, and identified seven solid leads, two of which
could close and bill by year-end.
 
"The credit really goes to Hank Spencer and his fellow sales reps,"
says Nancy Browning.
 
According to Hank, representatives from 18 different St. Louis
companies attended the seminar.  "The seminar solidified relationships
with two current prospects, both of which will be proceeding with
pilot programs."  Five other opportunities were "uncovered."
 
Hank thanks the "ACS organization, and especially St. Louis consultant
Carol Burkett and Houston consultant D'Juanna Beer, who did an
outstanding job in their presentations and demonstrations of ACS
products."
 
San Francisco just completed its seminar with similar results.
 
Says Nancy, "If you commit yourself and follow up, you'll get a
handsome payoff."  At press time, the schedule for future seminars is

 . . . . . . . . . . NEWS FROM ACS FEDERAL PROGRAMS . . . . . . . . . .
 
ACS Federal Programs expanded OnTyme and installed a local area
network (LAN) communications interface for the Army Corps of
Engineers.  "The number of Army Corps of Engineers staff using OnTyme
will increase from 2,000 to 10,000 in the next two months as a result
of a new contract," reports Russ Service, Manager of ACS Federal
Programs.
 
The Federal Programs organization markets ACS systems to the U. S.
Government here and abroad, and provides a 22-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week
hotline service to federal users.  In addition, the organization
provides pre- and post-sales technical support to commercial ACS
accounts in the Washington, DC area.
 
OnTyme training is one of the organization's strengths.  Using their
own hands-on training program, the Federal Programs staff has trained
1200 federal users of OnTyme worldwide.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 4
 
Federal Programs also provides ongoing support for Army Corps of
Engineers applications installed on the Tymcomm 370.  These
applications are accessed by users in the U. S., Europe, Korea, Japan,
Philippines, Panama, and other international locations.
 
Currently Russ's organization is installing micro engines at Army
Corps of Engineers sites in Washington, DC and Germany to interface
LANs with TYMNET.
 
If you have questions about federal contract procedures or want to
exchange information about LAN communications interfaces, contact Russ
Service at ACS.GOVMAIL.
 
 
 . . . . SEPTEMBER PROFILE:  MARKETING SERVICES, PART II . . . . .
 
ACS Marketing Services consists of five units managed by Shirley
Macemon.  These units are responsible for:
 
* Product documentation (user's guides, reference manuals, and
  primers) and marketing support materials (brochures, data sheets,
  and various other sales aids)
* Sales and training materials
* Public relations and advertising
* Building administration in VG-3
 
Last month's Newsflash profiled Marketing Publications, Production
Services, and Marketing Promotions.  This month, we focus on Training
Services, Building Administration, and Course Development.  These
three units are responsible for
 
* sales and professional development training and course development
* building administration in ACS headquarters
 
TRAINING SERVICES . . . .
 
At first, Training Services might sound quite a bit like Course
Development -- until you look at the primary purposes of the two.
Course Development develops; Training Services administers.  Carlota
Santa Cruz, Manager of Training Services, sees the function of the
department more as the developer of a career training path rather than
particular technical courses.  Training Services programs include
 
- ACS Product School
- AC Exchange Week
- Presentation Skills
- Selling ACS Workshop
 
The courses that happen to lie along this path can come from a variety
of sources - Deltak, Xerox, internal development, or other sources.
 
To develop career training paths, Carlota evaluates all the available
courses and arranges them into a logical sequence.  When holes appear
in this sequence either she or Course Developer Sarah Chamlee Kinkel
develop the needed material.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 5
 
Valerie Minder, Training Support Specialist, has just begun to
facilitate the FOCUS Data Base Management class.  Additionally, she
checks for proper registration forms and tracks each student along the
proper training paths.
 
Training Services usually doesn't deal with technological concepts.
Training Services emphasizes the "how to sell" aspect of education;
for example, the "How to Sell ACS Products" Seminar deals primarily
with the consultative sale rather than the product sale.
 
The future should see more regional training schedules, including
workshops, facilitated by Carlota and Valerie or by ACS employees
trained in course facilitation by Carlota and Valerie.  For the
present, the training schedule is available on *** ACS.TRAININGSCHED.
Descriptions of the available courses are referenced from that file.
 
COURSE DEVELOPMENT . . . .
 
Course Development, in the words of Course Developer Sarah Chamlee
Kinkel, is responsible for developing courses not already covered by
Training Services or other packaged sources.
 
Course Development projects come from various sources:  ACS
consultants, product managers, or the training group itself.  Two
current projects originated with Terry Fujimoto and Shirley Macemon -
a Data Communications course called Bisynchronous Connections to the
Network, section one of four that will be delivered under the title
ACS Technologies Solutions Training.
 
Sarah manages the development projects from inception to completion.
This includes developing objectives, mustering resources to provide
technical input, writing handout and support materials, training
initial facilitators, and distributing packaged materials.
 
BUILDING ADMINISTRATION . . . .
 
A pleasant environment to do your work in is mandatory if you expect
to do good work.  Lighting has to be adequate, heating/air
conditioning has to work properly, telephones have to ring when
they're supposed to, and hardwires need to connect to the correct
equipment.  Even the colors need to soothe.  All of these working
condition concerns are in the care of Diane Gordon.
 
Her position as Building Administrator put her in the critical role of
supporting ACS while it supports you:  with security services,
maintenance, telecommunications, space planning, and construction.
Primarily, in her words, her job is to make sure ACS "gets its needed
services easily and quickly."

2.  IBM Displaywriter has been removed from the standard.  The 
    IBM PC and IBM PC/XT with MultiMate are the standard systems 
    for word processing.  User Support Centers will provide 
    support for all installed Wang and Displaywriter systems, 
    but expansion of these systems, which require procurement of 
    hardware or software, is not authorized.

3.  Configurations in Encl (1) were modified to add Lotus 1-2-3 
    productivity aids, high speed hard disk backup capability 
    and graphics software.

4.  The User Support Centers are available to provide 
    information and assistance for configurations and ordering.

SUBJECT>   NEW PROCEDURES - CHANGES TO HRD ONTYME FILES


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Due to the Benefit Conversion and the new Payroll Attendance 
System, Human Resources has found it necessary to make some
changes to the *** HRD exec files on Ontyme.  The ONTYME 
programs will be revised effective September 30. All prior formats
after that date cannot be accepted, due to these changes.
 
 *  NEW HIRES, REHIRES AND CHANGES FROM TEMP TO PERM
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.NEWEMPLOYEE
 
We have added scheduled shift, hours and work week.  These items must be
entered for all employees. For part time employees also note that 
weekly/annual base pay is to be calculated on a 40 hour work week.  
All appropriate paperwork must continue to be sent to Human Resources and
your Personnel Coordinator if applicable.
 
Assigned shift times are as follows:
     
 1st Shift:  If start time is between  4:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon
 2nd Shift:  If start time is between 12:00 noon and  8:00 p.m.
 3rd Shift:  If start time is between  8:00 p.m. and  4:00 a.m.
 
 *  TERMINATIONS
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.TERMINATION
                                                                Page  2

 
Since vacation time will be tracked on PPS II we have deleted accrued
and carryover vacation from this exec.
 
 
 *  JOB STATUS AND PERSONAL STATUS CHANGES
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.CHANGES
 
This  exec has been added to,  due to the benefit  changes.   Use 
this exec to report and change to scheduled shift, scheduled work
week (days off), or scheduled work hours.  A memo from Dan Tosh
dated  Aug  15 is attached,  that clearly defines  these  fields. 
  
Leaves of abscences will also be reported on this exec, for all
absences  more than 5 consecutive days,  employees must be placed 
on leave.  All leaves must include the type of leave and the
projected date of return.
 
If you have any questions or problems you may contact me at
408/446-7756 or via ONTYME at HRD.PERSONNEL 
 
 
 
 
PLEASE NOTE: THESE CHANGES WILL BE SEEN ON THESE FILES MONDAY,
             SEPTEMBER 30.

SUBJECT>   ISG BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. This memo is a follow-up to the July 22 memo from Joe Walton, in
   which several ISG Benefit topics were introduced.
 
   * Scheduled Shift
     The PPSII (Payroll Personnel System) will require assigned shift
     for all employees in order to insure correct payment of shift    
     premium. The data collection system mentioned in the first memo
     will collect the assigned shift of all ISG Tymshare employees as
                                                                Page  3

     of 09/30/85.  This will be done from 09/24 thru 09/27.
 
     After the benefit conversion (09/30/85) changes to assigned shift
     for more than 5 consecutive days must be reported to Cupertino
     Human Resources no later than the week in which the employee 
     changes shift, in order to assure accurate attendance processing.   
     Changes to assigned shift of less than 5 consecutive work days do 
     not require a change to the personnel system. 
 
  
   * Scheduled Work Week
     For proper attendance and absence reporting, a correct record of
     an employee's work week (scheduled days off) will be carried in the 
     PPSII system.  The general data collection (09/24 thru 09/27) will
     supply PPSII with the correct work week for each  employee as of 
     09/30/85. Thereafter changes to this assigned work week will need
     to be reported to Cupertino HR for update.
 
 
   * Scheduled Working Hours
     For Part Time employees, an accurate record of work schedule will 
     be critical. Benefit eligibility will be determined based on
     scheduled hours per week.

DUE TO SOME CONFUSION LATELY ABOUT THE PROCEDURES WE FOLLOW AT
THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER REGARDING CORPORATE ARCHIVES, I AM 
SENDING THE ONTYME TO CARIFY THE SITUATION.
 
1.  ANY ARCHIVE SENT TO THE ZANKER ROAD DISTRIBUTION CENTER FOR 
    STORAGE SHOULD BE IN STANDARD ARCHIVE BOXES, AND SHOULD
    BE MARKED CLEARLY ON THE FRONT PANEL WITH ALL THE NECESSARY
    INFORMATION:
 
    A.  DEPARTMENT WHO IS STORING ARCHIVE
    B.  CONTENTS OF ARCHIVE
    C.  DATE SENT OVER
    D.  DESTRUCTION DATE
 
2.  WE WILL THEN STORE THE ARCHIVE IN ANY AVAILABLE SPACE THAT WE
    HAVE WITHIN THE TWO DESIGNATED PALLET ROWS.
 
3.  IF YOU REQUIRE A CERTAIN ARCHIVE TO BE SENT TO YOU PLEASE CALL
    STEPHANIE AT 942-5330 AND GIVE HER ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION.
    SHE WILL THEN RELAY THIS INFORMATION TO OUR ARCHIVE CLERK,
    JOHN HEZLITT, WHO WILL SEARCH FOR THE ARCHIVE YOU NEED.
 
4.  STEPHANIE WILL CALL YOU BACK WITHIN 24 HOURS TO NOTIFY YOU OF
    EITHER 1) WHEN & HOW THE ARCHIVE WAS SHIPPED TO YOU OR 2) OF
    OUR INABILITY TO FIND THE SPECIFIED ARCHIVE.
 
5.  IF WE WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE REQUIRED ARCHIVE, YOU WILL
    NEED TO COME DOWN TO THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND LOOK YOURSELF
    WITH THE HELP OF JOHN HEZLITT, OUR ARCHIVE CLERK.
 
6.  IF YOU NEED TO COME TO OUR FACILITY TO LOOK THROUGH ANY ARCHIVES,
    AGAIN PLEASE ASK STEPHANIE AND ARRANGE FOR A TIME THAT YOU CAN COME 
    DOWN.  JOHN WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU IN ANY WAY NECESSARY AT THIS
    TIME.

Success!  Partial success anyway... it has effectively shown that
the mailer can be set to RPG or TUMS and it works!  (This is the
TUMS mail, in case you didn't notice.)

The message needs a little sprucing up, but that's trivial compared
to getting through everything successfully.   ...more later...

Subject: Hotline call system 57, disk problems 

I just finished poing around trying to fix "serious errors" as reported
by DSKCLN on system 57.  It was dying with PCBIO stopcds, @ CTLFN1+...
when it searched throught the entire PCB list without finding the page
(rib, sat, or upt?) page it was looking for... sounds ominous like either
the disk or the memory was garbaged...  I couldn't find anything that I
could fix.  A few counts were off and a few bad ribs.  I left it with
Tom running a full dskcln to fixup the bad files... I did fix the refresh/
missing/inconsistant packset id problem and fiddled a few files to get
DSKCLN to decide that the errors were "serious to users" but not "serious
to the system"...

I've scheduled lunch with Bill Soley @ 1:30 pm in campbell, so after my
sleepless morning... I may or may not make it to the office this afternoon.

Call me if you need me., or beep me if I'mnot home...  /Carl

Subject: WRTST1 output on WRTSAT STOPCD wrong 

Joe,
  WRTST1 prints garbage on the CTY... at least the page number it's
printing is wrong...   PGYADR, PGYLMA, et al  are pointers which
depend on (PG) and the correct PG is on the stack somewhere at the
time the STOPCD WRTSAT is encountered.  The "bogus" value in PG
at the time is %SAT.C and gives no useful information.

  Can we determine how far down the stack has gone from the point the
actual STOPCD occurrs and it gets to the "additional typeout" routine
so that we can restore PG before the LDB T1,PGYADR ...   If so, can it
be made into a patch so that we can try to track down the problems on
system 29 & 57.

The updated version of WRTSAT.PAT has been TELECOPY'd to 29 and 57 and
installed there.  I made the in-line text shorter to get 2 words of patch
space.  The contents of accumulator PG is now at WRTST1+7, not on the stack.

    MCDONNELL DOUGLAS       ADMINISTRATIVE     NO:  ISG-85-145
INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 20 Sep 85



To:       All ISG Employees

Subject:  ISG EDUCATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT



Employees are encouraged to increase their capabilities and 
value to ISG by participating in approved educational programs, 
whereby the costs of the educational program are refunded to the 
employee to the extent specified in this policy.

This program is applicable to all full time regular employees of 
ISG employing companies as designated by the ISG Management 
Committee.

Career development programs eligible for reimbursement fall into 
two (2) categories as follows:

1.  Adult Education Program

    The Adult Education Program provides assistance to employees 
    participating in non-credit courses designed to develop 
    potential capabilities.  The Adult Education Program 
    consists of the following:

    - High school equivalency preparation
    - High school diploma
    - Remedial education
    - Job related vocational courses

2.  College Study Program

    A program which falls into one of the following categories:

          Job related: An educational program which when taken, 
          is expected to improve the employee's performance in 
          his/her current position and/or increase the 
          employee's capabilities for promotion into a higher 
          position within ISG organizations.

          Certificate/Degree related:  An undergraduate or post 
          graduate curriculum at an accredited college or 
          university which is related to the employee's 
          profession or other business related professions which 
          the employee intends to pursue within ISG 
          organizations.



Eligibility

    To be eligible for reimbursement of educational costs, an 
    employee must be a full-time regular employee at the time of 
    enrollment and at the time the course is successfully 
    completed.  In addition, the employee must be in an active 
    pay status at the time of course completion and must not be 
    on a leave of absence.  Those who retire, are laid-off, or 
    enter active United States military service after 
    enrollment, but prior to course completion, may be eligible 
    for reimbursement, provided all other requirements have been 
    met.

    The course or program must be conducted by an approved 
    and/or accredited educational institution.

    Courses, programs and subjects undertaken must receive 
    approval by employee's supervisor and acknowledgments by 
    their local Human Resources organization prior to the start 
    of the course.

    An employee who is eligible for tuition assistance through 
    veterans' benefits, federal aid, scholarship or other such 
    programs after reporting such eligibility, may be eligible 
    for that portion not covered as specified in this policy.

Enrollment

    Employees will be limited to enrollment in not more than two 
    (2) courses plus one (1) lab per semester.

    ISG reserves the right to exclude from inclusion in this 
    plan any educational institution.

Reimbursement

    Upon satisfactory completion of each college study course (a 
    minimum grade of "C" or equivalent, provided "C" meets the 
    school requirements for degree objective), 80% of tuition, 
    enrollment fees, textbooks, required instructional material, 
    laboratory, and other recurring fees will be reimbursed.  
    Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not 
    reimbursable.  Grades are based upon an A, B, C, D, and F 
    scale.  In Adult education programs which are graded "A" 
    thru "F", the "C" grade rule applies for eligibility for 
    reimbursement.  Other evidences of satisfactory completion, 
    such as diplomas, certificates or letters from the 
    institution are acceptable when no grades are given.

    Maximum employee reimbursement per calendar year is $3,000 
    and presentation of evidence of course/program completion, 
    grades and receipts are required.



Reimbursement  (Continued)

    The Educational Reimbursement Plan is not a contract.  It 
    may be terminated or modified at any time without prior 
    notice.

    Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not 
    subject to income tax withholding or reporting to the 
    Internal Revenue Service.

Educational Leave of Absence

    Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and 
    approved the same as all other leaves of absence, with the 
    exception that approval of the cognizant Department Head and 
    Human Resources is also required.

    Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not 
    authorized, except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in 
    which case reimbursement is limited to a maximum of twelve 
    (12) months during required residency.

Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

    The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree 
    programs only and requires the approval of the cognizant 
    Department Head and Human Resources.  The reduced work week 
    permits salaried employees to work not less than twenty (20) 
    hours nor more than forty (40) hours per week.  This plan 
    stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on actual 
    hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to 
    the beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  
    The work schedule is established not normally to exceed 
    eight (8) hours per day.

Approval of Educational Program

    Employees applying for educational reimbursement will 
    complete an "ISG Educational Reimbursement Application" at 
    least two (2) weeks prior to the first class meeting.  The 
    application must be approved by the employee's supervisor 
    and acknowledged by their local Human Resources organization 
    to assure consistency related to guidelines.

    Human Resources will review the application and notify the 
    supervisor of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will 
    then notify the employee.  If the application is not 
    approved, the employee will be informed of the reason.



Obtaining Reimbursement

    Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) 
    weeks from the last scheduled meeting of the course, the 
    employee must submit to Human Resources:

          An official grade report or other evidence 
          establishing satisfactory completion of the course(s) 
          as specified under the "Reimbursement" section.

          Official receipts showing actual costs paid for 
          tuition, required textbooks, and other eligible course 
          fees paid to the educational institution.

    Human Resources will complete the authorization section 
    showing approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational 
    Reimbursement Application".  The authorization is then 
    forwarded to Accounts Payable for payment to the employee.

    When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown 
    that non-completion was due to Company action, other than 
    discharge for cause, the refund may be granted provided that 
    all other conditions are met.

Subject:  MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION NATIONAL CAR RENTAL 
          CORPORATE-WIDE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

To:       McDonnell Douglas Corporation Plant Lists A-H; Post 
          Bulletin Boards



1.  McDonnell Douglas Corporation has again signed an exclusive 
    supplier agreement with National Car Rental system, Inc. 
    beginning 01 October 1985 through 30 September 1986.  This 
    agreement replaces the previous National contract which 
    expires on 30 September 1985.  National Car Rental is to be 
    used by all reservation functions and by any individual MDC 
    traveler on company business with or without advance 
    reservations.  All car rentals should be made through 
    National, even for the few locations which have no National 
    services (since National will reimburse the rate 
    differences).  MCAIR Travel Services in St. Louis has been 
    assigned responsibility by MDC Corporate Office to 
    administer this agreement for all MDC locations.

2.  With the new agreement, unlimited mileage daily rates for 
    compact size vehicles ("B" size) returned to the same rental 
    location range for $26.00/day in St. Louis, Los Angeles, 
    Phoenix and Long Beach to $27.00/day throughout the 
    remainder of the United States.  Domestic weekly rates are 
    five times the daily rate and monthly rates are three times 
    the weekly rate.  The agreement also provides for Canadian 
    and international discounts.  One-way rentals are charged a 
    reduced time and mileage rate.  National should be notified 
    of the one-way rental at the time of reservation booking to 
    prevent a drop charge.

3.  The same Corporate rates have again been extended to MDC 
    employees for personal travel.  To obtain the Corporate rate 
    for personal rentals, employees should identify themselves 
    as MDC employees when they call National Car Rental at 
    1-800-328-4567 for their reservation.  The Human Resources 
    Office and Recreation Department have National Car 
    Identification cards which should be used with the 
    employees' MDC badges to obtain the MDC rate for personal 
    travel.

4.  All Corporate and personal domestic rentals include full 
    insurance coverage [Collision Damage Waiver, (CDW)].  
    International rates do not include insurance and must be 
    obtained at the time of rental.  On personal rentals, for 
    insurance coverage beyond the free CDW, any necessary 
    personal credit reference and driver's license requirements 
    remain the responsibility of the employee.



5.  If National Car Rental fails to provide a vehicle that has 
    been confirmed within 45 minutes after the traveler arrives 
    at their counter, a written notice along with a copy of the 
    car rental agreement should be sent to MCAIR Travel 
    Services, Dept. 028, Bldg. 275, in St. Louis.  The delay 
    will result in a $25.00 credit rental certificate.  If 
    National fails to comply with the preceding within one (1) 
    hour of the employees' arrival at the rental counter, 
    National will be responsible for a $100.00 penalty.  All 
    penalty certificates are payable to MDC, and will be used to 
    reduce the applicable component's monthly car rental cost.

6.  Where possible, the MDC Huntington Beach, Long Beach or 
    St. Louis Travel Departments should be utilized for making 
    business trip car rental reservations.  MDC receives a 
    commission on any car reservations made through these 
    departments which will help to hold down the Corporation's 
    ever-increasing travel expenditures.

7.  Please route this AB to all personnel in your organization 
    to notify travelers or reservation functions prior to 
    01 October 1985.  Any questions on this agreement should be 
    referred to Travel Services at 314/234-6666 in St. Louis; 
    714/896-2872 in Huntington Beach and 213/593-7565 in Long 
    Beach.

Subject:  Five Keys to Self Renewal; Special Assignment - 
          J. H. MacDonald



1.  Over the past four years, we have introduced the Five Keys 
    to Self Renewal; Strategic Management, Participative 
    Management, Human Resource Management, Productivity 
    Improvement and Ethical Decision Making.  Each of these 
    initiatives are interrelated and are necessary at MDC to 
    improve our competitive business position and ensure our 
    long-term survival.  It's our assessment that we are well 
    into what might be called the "awareness-informational- 
    experimental" phase of these Five Keys.  The big task ahead 
    of us is to guarantee that the Keys become fully implemented 
    and integrated into each of our jobs.  The Keys can't be 
    something we do in addition to our daily jobs but instead 
    must be literally built into the way we each carry out our 
    work.

2.  Because of the importance we place on this, we have asked 
    Jim MacDonald, Corporate Vice President - Human Resources, 
    to spend 90% of his time and effort over the next year on 
    ensuring that the Five Keys become fully implemented and 
    integrated into every function throughout the Corporation as 
    announced separately in Administrative Bulletin 85-74.

3.  The two of us will also be giving this Five Keys activity a 
    great deal of personal management direction.

Subject:  NEW DIRECTOR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PLANNING



I am pleased to announce that Kevin P. McKeon has joined the 
MDISI organization as Director Business Management Planning 
effective 7 October 1985 reporting to me.

Kevin's twelve years of successful sales, marketing and 
management experience began in 1973 with the Burroughs 
Corporation where he advanced from Sales Representative to Sales 
Manager and Sales Instructor.  He joined Tymshare in 1978 to 
establish the new office in Minneapolis and later he became 
Branch Manager in St. Louis.

In 1982, Kevin was selected as the Manager of Electronic Data 
Interchange and was responsible for the basic development of EDI 
as a business opportunity for Tymshare.  His most recent 
position was that of Tactical Marketing Manager for the EDI 
product in the McDonnell Douglas Electronic Data Interchange 
Systems Company.

Kevin's responsibilities in this position will focus primarily 
on strategic planning and marketing issues for the MDISI 
business unit.  In this role he will be instrumental in the 
maturation of MDISI into a marketing driven organization.

Please join me in welcoming Kevin to MDISI and in assisting him 
in the fulfillment of his new responsibilities.

Subject: FCR.E+3/4 

I followed the code a little further...
  it goes as follows... the user is doing SIMIO output and ends up at
  SIMBOU:  no problems, @SIMBO1+15 does a PUSHJ P,DDO(T1) which does
  a JRST OUTBLT.    P1,T4 are put on the stack, SIMIOA returns with a
  page in  %UPT+UPTSIM(W), SIMIOB sets up the POS in J and %UPT+UPTPOS(W),
  NEDMAP (bit 20) is set so we see PUSHJ P,SIMIOM @OUBLT0+15.  [No idea
  about whether SIMRMV is called, but I doubt it else we couldn't get a
  #3 error from map-file-page.]  SIMIOM puts P1,P2 on the stack, NEDRMV
  is not set, cause we made it past the STOPCD.  IO was set in S, so we
  jump off to SIMIM1 for output.  GOTPHP is set, so we hurry down to
  SIMIM2 where we call SIMCRE to do the right stuff with the output file.
  That probably succeeds (since we know we got a MAPERR not a FCRERR) and
  we try to map the page @SIMIM3+2.  That fails with #3 %FLVEX (FALVEX)
  and we go into the literal that clobbers the page number and JSPs to
  MAPERR which clobbers the page number again and sets the UUO value to 1
  and scurries off to SIMIMF which pops P2,P1 back into place, sets up S
  from DEVIOS(F) and returns to  OUBLT0+15  which goes to SIMIOS which
  pops T4,P1 back from the stack.  T1 = UUO,,ERR  == 1,,3  is pushed on
  the stack for the UUO-range check.  Then at MAP.E/FCR.E it's popped
  back off the stack, mangled and checked...  we then hit our STOPCD at
  FCR.E+3 (old FCR.E+4).

Looking at the stack, it's clear that 1001,,3 is returned from the CHANIO
UUO (EPT+1,,PG)[suspicious no?]  and that we have some other clues to
verify this.
  %UPT+UPTIOC[ usecount  which is found in %UPT+UPTSIM(W)[ usecount,,501001
  and %UPT+UPTPOS(W)[ 11  which was also in DEVPOS(F).  We can now check
  the old FCR.E+4 crashes for lh[ UPTSIM(W) ]==UPTIOC to find out what page
  and status bits {GOTPHP,NEDRMV,NEDMAP,GOTHOL} are set.  In this case, the
  501001 says GOTPHP,NEDMAP,page 1001.  %UPT+UPTPBM[ 600000,,177777  which
  says ppp 1000 & 1001 are marked in use.

It's possible that more checks for NEDRMV are needed, or a non-faulting
test is needed to see if the page IS there even though NEDMAP is set?
I looked at SIMRMV and it looks like it makes sure that the page is gone
one way or the other... so we need to make sure that the page is NOT in
the indicated slot for that channel.  GOTPHP and USETO may play a part in
this too.  Need to insure that USETO will clear GOTPHP if the pos is less
than DEVPOS(F)/UPTPOS(W).   sigh.

Hope you can follow this commentary through the crash and dig up any new
leads on what to look at.  I've already spent too much time looking at it
instead of doing other things.  /Carl

Subject: INSSIM+2 crashes on D25. 

All 15 of the INSSIM+2 crashes on D25 were the same.  The symptoms were:
JOB pointed to a frame that was running LOGOUT.
%UPT+UPTPDL/ CAME 400323	;1 past the EVICT uuo in LOGOUT
	710/ 4000,,USRMPE+2 or 4000,,USRXIT+22 ;left over garbage
	711/ 4000,,UUOPN1+5	;UUOPNT+8 has PUSHJ P,UUODSP
	712/ execflags,,PC	;Exec PC of the ILL INST, always  .LT. MAXJOB
	713/ 32001		;Result of CONI MTR,T1 on a KL
  P/    714/ UUOKNT+12		;UUOKNT+11 has PUSHJ P,UUODSP

Diagnosis: The EVICT uuo in PICON has the following:
	PUSH   P,T1		;Save the target job number
	PUSHJ  P,FARCHK		;Fast access rights check for HALT access
	  POPJ P,		;Not allowed

If the check for access rights fails for any resaon, the POPJ jumps to an
illegal instruction in low core.

Cure:	Change EVICT+5 from POPJ P, to JRST TPOPJ.  This fix is in 
	(M33)EVICT.PAT and will be distributed to all systems.

Note: Carl found that the bug was introduced in the P034/B monitor.
	It only occurs when someone with account supervisor privileges
	tries to kill another frame with the same GAN, and the attempt fails.
	The attempt is supposed to work, and does if the killer has license.

Craig,

    The class registration person I spoke with at Tymnet Training told
me that no training material of any kind is available outside of their
classes.  A 'blue dollar' savings might be realized by sending only one
person to a Tymnet class, then using that person to teach the rest of us
whatever is needed.

        alarmed but can be used as emergency exits.

    
2.  A fence is planned for the rear of the court yard when this fence
    is built the doors that exit into the courtyard will be left
    unlocked during working hours for the convenience of the employees
    but until that time these doors will remain locked and alarmed.

3.  The above new security procedures are being taken to increase
    security to MDC employees and to stop the unauthorized removal 
    of MDC property .

4.  Your observance of these new security procedures will be appreciated.

My "extra" beeper battery doesn't seem to want to charge at all.  I've
had it charging in the spare slot on my charger and when I went to use
it on Friday, it was dead as a doornail!  I've tried charging it a little
inside the beeper while turned on, and again it doesn't seem to work.  I
haven't tried it with the beeper OFF, because I wanted to make sure Osman
or Joe was available while I had the beeper OFF.

I may want to try another charger or another battery... anyway, if I don't
answer the page this weekend, it's because my batteries are on the blink,
so feel free to call me if you need help.. /Carl

Subject:  CHANGES IN ISG ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



When ISG's top management structure was formed in June of this 
year, it was built around the complementary capabilities 
Gary Liebl and I brought to our respective positions.  Now, 
Gary's departure has compelled us to re-evaluate that structure 
and decide whether to continue with out Group Executive/Group 
Operating Officer arrangement or switch to a simpler arrangement 
that consolidates all reporting under one Group executive.

As is clear from the attached preliminary organizational chart*, 
we have chosen the latter.  The purpose of this A.B. is to 
announce a number of organizational changes related to this 
revised organizational structure, all of which are effective 
immediately.

First, in order to have a manageable number of people reporting 
directly to me, I have made the following changes in reporting 
relationships:

    .  John Clancy now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company, John will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
       Systems Company, under Otis Brinkley, President, and 
       McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
       Company, under Buck Yoder, Executive Vice President and 
       General Manager.

    .  Vern Smith now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Computer Systems Company, Vern will oversee the 
       activities of McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, 
       under Vern Hart, President.  Since one of the Field 
       Service Company's primary tasks is to maintain Computer 
       Systems hardware in the marketplace, this grouping will 
       facilitate an even closer working relationship in this 
       activity.

ISG-85-162

    .  Rich Calvert now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Diversified Information Systems Company, Rich will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Information 
       Processing Company, under Ted Bellan, President.  While 
       the Information Processing Company serves many ISG 
       business units, Diversified is its largest customer.  As 
       with Computer Systems and Field Service, this grouping 
       will be beneficial to both parties.

    .  McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company, under 
       Leo Mirowitz, President, reported to me before Gary 
       became Group Operating Officer.  Now this company will 
       again report directly to me.  I am also pleased to 
       announce that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
       International Company, under Jerry Causley, President, 
       will now for the first time report directly to me.

It is important to note that, while some business units are 
being grouped for reporting purposes under a few ISG senior 
executives, there is no intent to change individual business 
unit missions or consolidate operations and financial 
reporting.  The companies being grouped together are still key 
elements of the ISG strategy and will continue to function 
independently.  I will continue to take a personal interest in 
these business units, but I must rely on John, Vern and Rich to 
oversee the direct management of these organizations.

Along with the above business unit realignments, I am making the 
following changes in the structure of ISG's Group-level staff 
organizations:

    .  Charlie Dignan, Staff Vice President-Corporate Accounts, 
       now reports to Jim Donovan, Vice President of Marketing 
       and Planning-ISG.

    .  Stan Bjurstrom, Chief Counsel-ISG (East), and 
       Hank Kohlmann, Chief Counsel-ISG (West), now report to 
       Mark Kuhlmann, Staff Vice President and Associate General 
       Counsel-ISG.

    .  Bernie Hathaway, Staff Vice President-Productivity, now 
       reports directly to me.

    .  Dennis Carvalho, Director of Human Resources-ISG 
       (St. Louis), now reports to Mike Becker, Staff Vice 
       President of Human Resources-ISG.


ISG-85-162

Some further organizational changes are being made in response 
to our need to limit the number of strategic thrusts we can 
realistically pursue at one time.  These changes are summarized 
below:

    .  For the time being, we have decided to eliminate 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company's 
       growth strategy and to focus on the activities of 
       McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  As a result, 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company, 
       as it was organized earlier this year, has been 
       dissolved.  Alden Heintz, President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Payment Systems Company, now reports directly to me in my 
       capacity as Group Executive Officer-ISG.

    .  In a related move, the Check Card and Credit Reporting 
       Development organizations, headed by John Mazzola and 
       David Jung and formerly part of McDonnell Douglas 
       Financial Transaction Systems, now report to 
       Otis Brinkley.  We believe in the need to continue work 
       on our Distribution Systems strategy, even though we have 
       limited 1986 funds available for this activity.  Because 
       we believe that both of these former Financial 
       Transaction Systems thrusts have synergy with our plans 
       for the wholesale/retail distribution industry, we want 
       them to be evaluated for integration into our 
       Distribution Systems strategy.

    .  The Computer Systems Marketing and Sales organization, 
       under Mike Coleman, has by all measurements had an 
       extremely difficult year in 1985.  In an effort to 
       strengthen this organization, it has been move out of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company, 
       and will now report to Otis Brinkley.  Considering that 
       about a third of our Computer Systems sales have 
       historically been into the retail distribution 
       marketplace and that Computer Systems products are 
       planned as the foundation of our Distribution Systems 
       strategy, this new alignment should allow ISG to take 
       better advantage of our domestic Computer Systems sales 
       force.  The fact that Distribution Systems, Computer 
       Systems Marketing and Sales and the Computer Systems 
       Company all are located in Irvine, California, will 
       facilitate a close working relationship among the three.

    .  As a result of the preceding change, the name of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company is 
       now McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company.  Warren 
       Prince will continue as President of this company, and 
       will report directly to me.

In the coming weeks, more details will be provided by the 
business units and staff organizations affected by these 
changes.  In the meantime, the attached preliminary 
organizational chart should help clarify our new top management 
alignment.

To:       ISG Employees Eligible for Benefits

Subject:  ISG OPTIONAL SPECIAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE PLAN



During the month of November 1985 eligible employees who are not 
now members may elect to enroll in the Optional Special Accident 
Insurance Program.  Current members may elect to make other 
changes, such as redesignation in the amount of insurance or 
inclusion of their family.

If an ISG employee is married to another ISG employee, and both 
are eligible for the Optional Special Accident Insurance, they 
may each elect coverage as employees but they may not insure 
each other as spouses.  If these employees have eligible 
children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

    Level of                Weekly Cost of Coverage For:
    Coverage                You Only        Your Family

    $ 25,000                 $ .23             $ .34
    $ 50,000                 $ .45             $ .68
    $ 75,000                 $ .68             $1.02

If you elect family coverage, consult your Group Insurance 
Summary Plan Description for the definition of an eligible 
child.  The benefit payable depends on your family makeup:

     SPOUSE ONLY       SPOUSE & CHILDREN       CHILDREN ONLY

         60%             Spouse - 50%               20%
                          Child - 10%

Enrollment cards can be obtained from your local Human Resources 
Office serving your area.  Completed cards must be dated during 
the month of November 1985, and forwarded to your Human Resource 
Office no later than November 29, 1985.

I am pleased to announce the appointment of Richard C. Gunther 
to the position of General Manager, Ontyme Systems, in the newly 
formed McDonnell Douglas Electronic Messaging Systems Company 
(MDEMS, a part of Network Systems Company).  Dick will report to 
Terry Donaher, Vice President, MDEMS.

Dick brings over 25 years of experience in the computing and 
communications industries to MDEMS.  Over the past four years, 
he has made many contributions to the strategic plans of Tymnet 
and the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group, most 
recently by chairing the ISG Communications Opportunities Task 
Force and by spearheading the effort to create MDEMS.  He was 
instrumental in the acquisition of FTC Communications, the other 
principal component of MDEMS.

During the balance of 1985, Dick will focus on developing a 1986 
operating plan for Ontyme Systems, and organizing the business 
unit to start the new year with increased momentum.

The recent announcement of the formation of MDEMS stressed that 
a key to ISG's success will be how well MDEMS works with all the 
other business units to distribute its products and services.  
Dick is making this his top priority.  Please join me in 
welcoming him to MDEMS and give him your full support in his 
efforts to achieve our mutual objectives.

SUBJ:  Idea to Control Disk Space Used by Node Code Files on Tymcom-X
	Hosts (25 & 70).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Beryl,

Last week's meeting with you and the Code Generators was fruitful.  I
believe we have worked out a means of deleting only unneeded files, such
as old "BK ..."  files for nodes which have stable current "ND ..."
files.  The solution I provided the staff in the meeting was only
temporary -- a means of getting the job done until a more effective,
efficient solution is found.

I've discussed your problem with the manager and staff of the Tymcom-X
Operating System Unit, and we would like to offer a suggestion or two,
for a potential solution which might offer multiple advantages over the
current method of storing the information contained in the .TYM, .CMD
and .Cnn files.


1.)  Since this information all appears to be pretty much the same type,
it appears to be a good candidate for a data base system.

The data base system could be designed to hold all the variable parts of
the source code needed to generate the node code.  It could have for
each node all the variable information needed in a .CMD file, and all
the parameter values needed for a .TYM file.  Thus, instead of 2 pages
of PDP-10 memory for a .CMD file and 2 pages of memory for a .TYM file,
all the variable information could be stored in one record in the data
base's data file.

Procedures would be included in this data base system to generate the
.TYM file and the .CMD file for a node and for each of its slots.  These
procedures need be stored on the PDP-10 only once, saving much space.

This proposed data base system could save the "old" information for the
node code in such a way as to keep it as backup.  The system could
include the ability to automatically delete backup data more than one
generation old, and could even allow choice of backup files for deletion
based on last access date.

In addition to the savings of disk pages provided, the proposed data
base system would provide the additional advantage of greatly reducing
the number of files in the directory.  This would greatly improve access
time to each node's data, and improve the operating system's access time
to individual files (e.g., for deletion), and allow the code generators
better control over the files and data sotred in the directory.

The proposed data base system would have some disadvantages:  it would
require some time to develop, and some change of procedure for code
generators; the data for a .TYM file or a .CMD file would no longer be
in the source code file with the expanatory comments; generating the
.TYM and the .CMD files would depend on procedures of the data base
system; immediate access to the .TYM files and their comments would not
be so available.


2.)  A much simpler way of keeping the files organized and of keeping
the number of files in the directory restricted would consist of placing
the files for each node in different directories:  the developmental
files in one directory, the current files in another directory, and the
backup files in another directory.  When a file is to change status,
such as go from 'current' to 'backup' status, the renaming would consist
of renaming from one directory to another directory, which can be done
with license set.

This would make each directory smaller, making access and deletions
quicker and more reliable, and would make it easier to maintain the
directories.  When the new Tymcom-X hosts are available for node code,
this might be worth considering.

3.)  Another system that has been suggested in our meeting, that I am
beginning to investigate, is a Code Management System.  Proprietary
software packages are available to manage source code for different
generations of code for a variety of systems.  These packages provide
efficient use of disk space, easy access to the code, and efficient
management of the information.

Information about these Code Management Systems for PDP-10s is available
from the DEC user community.  that is where I will look.

Subject: Problem with SCNSER running during STOPCD output. 

I was looking at (M33)SIMKL.MAC, and happened to come across a comment that
explains how we could be getting a stopcode in SCNSER while processing a
JOB or INFO stopcode.  I verified it in the Processor Reference Manual, on
page 3-8:  Bit 24 Request interrupts on levels selected by 1s in bits 29-35,
and force the processor to recognize them even on lefels that are off.

This means that the WRPI REQCLK at KEYSET+6 in PICON causes the channel 7
interrupt to be recognized, and a full SCNSER cycle and a full schedular
cycle is initiated.  This is most likely the cause of the recursion in
the stopcode handler.

I added a SKIPN .CPCPC in front of the WRPI REQCLK for the P034/P05 monitor.
That change needs to be put in all the P monitors when I get back.

	Mary Meyers - night operator

The phone numbers are (314)234-5588 and (314)234-5589.  Both phones are
near the KL CPUs, and if no answer, they ring over to (314)234-7175.  The
latter number is by the COEES VAX and is manned 24 hours a day.

Jim Crews is the supervisor of Production Services, his number is (314)233-4847.

Subject: Removal of usernames from systems 25, 33 and 70 

I just received a forwarded copy of your memo regarding the removal of
usernames from these 3 systems and I am *VERY* concerned that you would
even think of this kind of wholesale username annihilation.

I realize it is your responsibility to manage the system resources for
TYMNET, but this kind of action shows a marked lack of understanding of
the systems involved.  TYMCOM-X systems require a fairly substantial
list of GAN 1 and GAN 3 usernames for the smooth operation of both the
operating system itself and related utilities.  System accounting and
billing require some usernames in GANs 4 and 6.  Software distribution
requires usernames in GANs 1 and 11447.

I believe that there must be a better mechanism for consolidating the
system resources of TYMNET and removing unnecessary users from your new
or dedicated TYMCOM-X systems.

Please give me a call (afternoons) at 415-794-2515  or ext 116-2515 so
that we may talk about this matter.

/Carl

Subject: System 74's disk problem 

Around 11pm - got a call from Karen, the first attempt to copy the pack
bombed the system, had to start over.

Got on the system, ran full DSKCLN in check-out mode.  Only two files in
(TAPELIB) marked as bad, still had 24000 lost pages.

12:40am - Called data center, told them to deposit 1 in 30 and bring the
system up with a real FULL DSKCLN.  (Could not run TAKEIT because of network
problems.)

Subject: Network problems. 

I had difficulty getting to system 74.  The Fremont TYMSAT was not talking to
the supervisor, in that when I typed "JMS:930" or "JMS:74" it just sat there,
and did not ask for password.  I had to go thru Oakland to get the manual
DSKCLN started.  Once it was going, I typed two Control-C's, CCONTINUE, and
DETACH so I could hang up and try the Fremont node 3220 again.  It still
would not let me in as JMS from that node.  But username BUBB worked.
I typed C to get back to TYMNET, and was able to login JMS:74 and attach
to the DSKCLN job OK.

DSKCLN pointed out problems in [1,30773], user TAPELIB.  I GFD'd there,
went to do a DIR/EVERYTHING, and got no response on my terminal.  Tried hanging
up and redialing, had to go thru BUBB again, but got nothing after the
<beep>shut<beep> message.  At this point I called the Data Center and told
them to recycle system 74 with a full DSKCLN.

I had to login thru Oakland again, the Fremont node 3220 is not even talking
to BUBB now.

I answerred the message he left for us Friday morning.  He had questions about
running TWICE to define a new pack.  I left him my home phone number in case
he has problems running TWICE this weekend.  I haven't told him my beeper 
number, since I expect you might want to work out some sort of an arrangement
for that service.

By the way, his ONTYME name is IPC.B/FAIRCHILD, I told him to use TXS.J/SMITH
as my ONTYME name.

17-Nov-85 17:34/JMS
Contact:  Cupertino BLDG C, OPS, Karen, (408)446-7705, System C57

Symptom:  System dies in ONCE complaining about unit 15 off-line due to hardware
          errors, logical unit 5 missing from DSKB.  Operations called for
          software support in case problem was the same as "inconsistent pack
          set id".

Problem:  Advised them that problem sounded like hardware, and to try to the
          disk on a different drive.  Hardware called in.

Solution: Drive had a bad plug.  System answered at 18:49.

Joe:
I like the format of your "reports" on calls for TYmcom-X assistsance.
Can they go in a file anywhere or jst down the mail hole?\

PlEASE keep track of occurences and durations of phone call requests
from Brett Fairchild and company.  That goes for $85/hour since they
did not choose to buy any regular software maintenance.

Don't give jhim your beepeer number either.  We need to figure out a
way to givvvve him analog of TYMCOM-x emergency service at a price.

Brett called me Saturday evening.  I was on the phone two times for a
total of about an hour talking him thru the LONG dialog in TWICE.

The mail I sent about the hotline call used the same format the Carl
and Osman have been using.  It is in the INFO tree under "HOTLINE", and
is stored in (M33)HOTLIN.LOG.

Subject: RPORTN on system 95, micronode 6760. 

The off-by-one discrepency between the PDP-10 and its base also affects the
2020.  I noticed that the micronode was assigning port numbers starting at
17 when logging into 95, so I build a monitor with RPORTN=^D16.  That is,
one that would only accept port numbers 0-17 (octal, or 0-15 decimal) from
6760.  The monitor got two INFO stopcodes TTYBZP when it came up.  In each,
the message type was 43 (date/time from supervisor) and the port number was
20 (octal).  The system came up fine, and allowed me to login on TTY17 (octal).

The monitor 95XP07.SAV is currently built with RPORTN=^D17 so that it can
handle 16 real ports (00 to 17 octal) and one fake port TTY20 for date/time.

The micronodes on the Paris machines appear to assing port numbers starting
with 37 octal and working down, and never use ports 40 to 77.  Reducing RPORTN
for those 2020s would add to available free core.

On 25 October 1985 an OnTyme message was sent to all managers in
reference to the new property removal system.  It was requested
that all managers contact the Security Department for further
information.

This message is being sent to reissue the above request to all
managers so that the new property removal system can be properly
implemented.

Those managers who have already contacted the Security Department
in reference to the new property removal system should disregard
this message.

The Security Department can be reached at X7075 Monday thru Friday
8AM till 5PM.

    Personal  Computer  (PC) and IBM Personal Computer XT (PC/XT)
    devices   for   automated  office  systems.    Enclosure  (1)
    provides   the  current  standard  configurations  for  these
    systems.

2.  Configurations  in Enclosure (1) have been updated to reflect
    new  software versions for Multimate (Advantage Version 3.6),
    Lotus  1-2-3  (Version  2),  and  DOS  (Version  3.1).    All
    existing  PC  and  PC/XT users will receive software upgrades
    for  these products in December 1985.  Update procedures will
    be announced by separate Administrative Bulletin.

3.  Lotus  Version 2 will not require use of the system diskette,
    provides    accelerated    calculations    using   the   math
    coprocessor,  and  provides  file  password capability. Lotus
    1-2-3  Aids  in  Enclosure  (1)  have  been  removed from the
    Preferred  Options  due  to these features now being provided

          APPOINTMENTS



As  a result of the formation of the new Northern CA Metropolitan
Services  Organization,  I  am  pleased to announce the following
assignments.    This  organization  will  provide  facilities and
other  general  services  support  to ISG's Northern CA corporate
properties.    A  more  detailed  statement  of  charter is being
direct  mailed  to  affected  business  unit  presidents or their
designees.

    Bob  Beach  is appointed Manager - Plant Engineering Services
    with  responsibility  for interior design, space planning and
    allocation,   engineering   and  construction  services,  and
    regulatory  compliance.  Many of you will know Bob, as he has
    served  Tymshare and its predecessor companies for many years
    in  a  variety  of  capacities,  most  recently as Facilities
    Manager, Northern California properties.

    Leo  German  is  promoted  to  Manager - Maintenance Services
    with  responsibility  for  service  contract  administration,
    preventative  and  on-call maintenance, and landlord liaison.
    Leo  has  been with Tymnet almost two years, most recently as
    Staff   Facilities   Engineer,  Network  Facilities.    While
    relatively  new  to ISG, Leo has over 20 years' experience in
    facilities maintenance and operations.

    Chuck  Herman  is  appointed  Manager - General Services with
    responsibility  for  mail  services, reprographics, and voice
    communications.    Distribution  services, as well, are under
    study  for  possible  centralization  under  this department.
    Chuck  has  been  with  Tymnet  for  less than a year, in the
    capacity  of  Manager,  Non-Network Facilities.  While new to
    ISG,  Chuck has over 15 years' experience in general services
    and facilities operations.

    Wanda  Smith  is  continuing  in  her assignment as Manager -
    Administration.   However, as we have recently integrated our
    Network  Facilities  Department  with  the  new  Metropolitan
    Services   Organization,  Wanda's  responsibilities  will  be
    expanded  to include full support to the MSO.  Wanda has been
    with   Tymnet   almost   two  years,  following  considerable
    experience    in   other   Facilities,   Real   Estate,   and
    Administrative organizations.

    Mark  Lauver,  Director  of Facilities, MDNSC, will be Acting
    Manager  -  Metropolitan Services until further notice.  This
    organization,  as  well as the Network Facilities Department,
    will continue to report to Mark.

Please  join  me  in  congratulating  these  folks  on  their new
assignments  and  responsibilities.  They, and I, will appreciate
your support and cooperation as we tackle these new challenges.

Subject:  PLACEMENT,  ADVANCEMENT, COUNSELING AND TRAINING (PACT)
          PROGRAM


Entrance  into  the PACT Program's displaced workers and training
functions   was  suspended  in  August  1985  because  of  budget
constraints.    After  careful  consideration, we have decided to
discontinue  PACT  as  of  December  31,  1985.   The decision to
discontinue  PACT  was difficult and is based solely on financial
considerations.

The   Program   was   successful   in  redeploying  and  training
employees.    A  total of 299 ISG employees participated in PACT.
Eighty  three percent of this total or 248 employees were trained
and  placed  in new productive positions within ISG and other MDC
components.   The majority of the remainder had job offers within
MDC prior to leaving.

The  Internal  Placement  function will continue as part of Human
Resources  at  both  the  Business Unit and Regional levels.  All
transfers  within  or  between  ISG  Business  Units, group staff
organizations  and  MDC  organizations  external  to  ISG will be
administered  by  the  Human  Resources  function  supporting the
affected  organizations.    Transfers  for Business Units that do
not  currently  have Human Resources functions will be handled by
the  Regional  staffs.    Questions  concerning  support  at  the
regional  levels should be directed to Dennis Carvalho, St. Louis
Region, or Wylie Taylor, Western Region.

Our  appreciation  for  a  job  well  done  and  best  wishes for
continued  success  in  your  new  positions  to  the PACT team -
Jerry  Sexauer,  Mel  Bradford,  Regina  Higgins,  Larry Jenkins,

Subject:  Addition   to   Policy   5-MDC  section-ISG  Management
          Handbook



1.  Policy  5  in  the MDC section of the ISG Management Handbook
    discusses    the    HQ-authorized    manuals    which    have
    corporate-wide  applicability.    The appendix to this Policy
    contains a listing of those manuals.

2.  The   Corporate  Information  Resource  Management  Standards
    should be added to this appendix.

3.  The  purpose  of this manual is to disseminate Corporate-wide
    standards  for Information Resource Management principles and
    practices,   standards   for  systems  analysis  and  design,
    software,    equipment,    telecommunications,    information
    processing, systems integrity, and data administration.

4.  The  person responsible for development and revision of these
    standards  is  the  Director-Information  Resource Management
    Hardware/Software   Technology,   with  minimum  coordination
    required with the component IRM function heads.

5.  Distribution,  publication, and control of this manual is the
    responsibility  of  the  Manager-MDC  Procedures.    Approval
    resides  with  the  Staff Vice President-Information Resource
    Management.

6.  Other areas of the handbook remain unchanged.

7.  In  January  1986,  ISG Policy Management will distribute the
    quarterly  update  of the Management Handbook.  At that time,
    a  new  page  will  be  provided  to  update  the text in the
    Appendix  to  Policy  5 and include the Corporate Information
    Resource  Management Standards as a Corporate Manual.  In the
    interim,  please  make  a note of this change in your copy of
    the handbook.

Subject: P09 works in pages on C24. 

The good news is that I formatted, refreshed, and restored (SYS) to a one-pack
system on C24, using 3675 formatted in pages.  The bad news is that BOOTS does
not know how to read it.  I had to have the "blocks" pack on-line to get BOOTS
and the monitor (SYS)3675.SAV from it.  This test monitor then decides that the
"blocks" pack is improperly formatted, ignores it as being off-line, and only
looks at the "pages" pack.  Right now, the "pages" pack on BPA0 has only SYS:
from C34 and a few .SAV files in M33.

The next step is to jumper the 3650 for native mode, run (SYS)PAKCP5 from the
"blocks" pack to format the 3650, and use (SYS)3650.SAV to refresh it.

  Subject  Tymcom-X monitor urgently required for S90 (P034P).
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  We are currently involved in the process  of installing a Tymnet II base
  on  S90 (the  PDP10  installed here  in St.  Cloud).   Jack Snavely  has
  informed  us of  the  fact  that one  of  the  problems that  have  been
  detected, an  intermittent loss  of characters,  has been  solved on  US
  PDP10's by installing a recent release of the operating system.
 
  As this is one of the reasons why we have reverted to the Tymnet I base,
  and because of the  fact that we would like to test  the new software as
  much as possible, we would like to have the  new monitor release for S90
  very soon.
 
  It may, however, also be necessary  to update other system software. S90
  is currently still  running on a /K  monitor, and a lot  of software may
  have changed since. I  am not aware of what changes  may be necessary to
  move to a  /P monitor, (CUSPS, operator  procedures, user documentation,
  APL-related, etc).
 
  Could you give me the information I  will need to plan this upgrade cor-
  rectly ?  Tentatively, given  the current Tymnet  I elimination  date of
  Dec. 15th,  Tuesday night, Dec. 12th.   our time, seems  appropriate for
  the monitor  upgrade. (this  means the  day of  Dec. 12th.,  your time).
  Could you please confirm this schedule as soon as possible ?
 
  I can be contacted via ontyme on  ct.dpm, or mail to CTMKTG7:930, if you
  need more information or assistance.
 
  Best regards, Peter Stratman.

in native mode in pages.  This failed when it got to cylinder 542.  It did
however format the 5 alternate cylinders (559-555) and some of the regular
cylinders (554-543) before dying with "NO RECORD FOUND" for record 0 on
cylinder 542.  The REFRESH command, which usually clears problems like this
by resetting the assignment of alternate cylinders, could not reset RECORD 0
HEAD 0 CYLINDER 0.

  Osman brought up the SA10 diagnostics, formatted the 3650 in native mode
blocks.  I disabled the test in ONCE that checks for the special TYMSHARE
format on the disk, and we are now up running on the 3650 in native blocks.

To Osman and Carl: Why PAKCOP failed.

  When the 3650's were formatted in compatibility moded, the 815 logical
cylinders used physical cylinders 0-542 and half of 543.  The RECORD 0 (R)
and HOME ADDRESS (HA) information on these cylinders was correct for 3675
compatibility mode, but wrong for 3650 native mode.  PAKCP5 had no problem
formatting cylinders 559-544 since they still had the correct HA/R0 info
from the factory.  The question we had about the SET FILE MASK byte was a
red herring, octal 300 gives the most privileges, setting other bits disables
certain SEEK commands.

  The problem is that the commands PAKCOP uses to refresh HA and R0 on the
3675 and 3650 in compatibility mode get COMMAND REJECT when attempted on a
pack in native mode.  The 3674 manual states that the WRITE HOME ADDRESS
has an additional requirement for 3650 native mode - it must be proceeded by
a successful SEARCH HOME ADDRESS command.  That is:

	SEARCH HOME ADDRESS
	TIC back if search failed
	WRITE HOME ADDRESS
	WRITE RECORD 0

  The SA10 diagnostics did this when it formatted the 3650 in native blocks.
Now that valid HA and R0 info is on the disk, all we have to do is run the
existing PAKCP5 to format it in native pages.

Joe, I am in BLDG C today and I read you mail about formatting.
To see if everything works the way we are predicting, i will
go ahead and see if i can build a PAGE MONITOR/NATIVE MODE test system.

THE SOFTWARE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE DELAYED THE CONVERSION ARE BEING RE-
SOLVED AT A RAPID PACE.  WE EXPECT RESOLUTION OF THE REMAINING PROBLEMS
BY THIS WEEKEND.  IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CONVERSION AS ORDERLY AND 
QUICK AS POSSIBLE, WE ARE SCHEDULING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SUPER-
VISOR FOR 3:00 A.M. SUNDAY MORNING, 12/15.  THIS WILL ALLOW ONE WEEK
FOR CONVERSION, WHICH SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE FEW REMAINING NODES.

CURRENT STATUS OF SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ARE:

940 NET - THE AUX CIRCUIT PROBLEM WHICH IMPACTED VALIDATIONS ON MONDAY
          HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND TESTING IS CONTINUING.

E-BUSS - NEW CODE IS BEING LOADED NOW WHICH FIXES THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

         1.  INPUT PROCESSING BEING STOPPED

         2.  LOGINS FROM X.25

         3.  LOGIN FROM HSA

         THE PROBLEM OF LOST OUTPUT DATA IS A BUG IN AN OLD VERSION OF 
         THE MONITOR ON SOME OF THE ADP 10'S.  THE FIX IS TO LOAD THE 
         LATEST VERSION OF THE MONITOR.

HSA KATAKANA - NEW VERSION WHICH FIXES ALL KNOWN PROBLEMS.

GATEWAY - NEW VERSION RELEASED WHICH FIXES:

          1. LOADii PROBLEM

          2. CRASH FROM 6C63

I HOPE I HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THE KNOWN PROBLEMS.  IF THERE ARE ANY NEW
CONCERNS, PLEASE RESPOND IMMEDIATELY.  ITIME IS SHORT, AND CONVERSION 
BECOMES MORE CRITICAL WITH EACH PASSING DAY.


THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE IN THIS PROJECT,

  We are currently involved in the process  of installing a Tymnet II base
  on  S90 (the  PDP10  installed here  in St.  Cloud).   Jack Snavely  has
  informed  us of  the  fact  that one  of  the  problems that  have  been
  detected, an  intermittent loss  of characters,  has been  solved on  US
  PDP10's by installing a recent release of the operating system.
 
  As this is one of the reasons why we have reverted to the Tymnet I base,
  and because of the  fact that we would like to test  the new software as
  much as possible, we would like to have the  new monitor release for S90
  very soon.
 
  It may, however, also be necessary  to update other system software. S90
  is currently still  running on a /K  monitor, and a lot  of software may
  have changed since. I  am not aware of what changes  may be necessary to
  move to a  /P monitor, (CUSPS, operator  procedures, user documentation,
  APL-related, etc).
 
  Could you give me the information I  will need to plan this upgrade cor-
  rectly ?  Tentatively, given  the current Tymnet  I elimination  date of
  Dec. 15th,  Tuesday night, Dec. 12th.   our time, seems  appropriate for
  the monitor  upgrade. (this  means the  day of  Dec. 12th.,  your time).
  Could you please confirm this schedule as soon as possible ?
 
  I can be contacted via ontyme on  ct.dpm, or mail to CTMKTG7:930, if you
  need more information or assistance.
 
  Best regards, Peter Stratman.

Peter,

Carl Baltrunas tells me that he has patched the current P034/K Monitor on host
S90, to fix the character-loss bug.  This patch will allow host S90 to work
with the new base.  I'm sure that if Carl where not in a class he would be
giving you this information himself.

The P034/P monitor is not urgently needed for host S90, and thus other
software need not be changed to accomodate the new Tymnet-II base.

The monitor 24XP10 should be able to determine what kind of disk it is
running on, and reacts nicer to DEPOSIT 1 IN 30.  It hasn't been tested yet.

Subject: Re: 24XP10 
In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 13 Dec 85 0:24:16 PST

All the information about a disk is stored in the Unit Data Block.  Each
disk has its own UDB.  The information is set up for each disk, one unit at
a time at ONCE-only time.  Therefore you can have an RP06 and an RM03 on line
at the same time on a 2020, and can build a two-pack DSKB from them (but it
is not a good idea to have different types of disks in one structure).

BPXKON has always allowed a mixture of 100 Mb and 200 Mb disks on the same
string.  The capacity test would determine whether the disk had 404 or 808
cylinders, and the Monitor would happily use whatever was out there.

I had to remove the test for 3330-I (100 Mb) to fit 3650 definitions into a
two-bit field.  24XP10 is designed to recognize the following types of disk:
0 = 3350 in blocks (we won't be using this format other than for testing)
1 = 3330 in blocks (this is what all our systems currently use)
2 = 3350 in pages  (this is the approved format for 3650 disks)
3 = 3330 in pages  (to get 11% more our of existing disks)

This means, however, if both 3650 spindles are on-line, and they both say
they are DSKB0, then the Monitor will complain because it will see both,
even if one is formatted in native pages and the other is not.

Preliminary tests show it works fine after my few penciled-in changes.
It is ready for testing by the consumer.  I will try to talk to Phil

Subject: Bionic release %1(1) 

    The BIONIC rewrite is complete!  It has been placed on directory (SYS) on
systems 34, 55 and 57 for testing by all concerned parties.  I ran tests this
afternoon and could not get the new version to fail with (and without) the
new HSA.

    The features of both BIONIC and BIONIK are incorporated in the new
BIONIC program.  The new calling procedure is as follows:

            Katakana mode              Ascii mode     (default)

            -R BIONIC                 -R BIONIC
            *KATAKANA                 *ASCII          (may be omitted)
            *RUN                      *RUN
            OUTPUT TO FILE: filename  OUTPUT TO FILE: filename
            READY FOR INPUT           READY FOR INPUT

            (if through an HSA interface, 4 blank lines are printed)

            .... data transferred here ....

            nnn RECORDS INPUT         nnn RECORDS INPUT
            -                         -

ASCII mode is the default and simply calling BIONIC in the old way (by
omitting the command "ASCII") will create an ASCII mode file on the disk.

In 2780 mode (through an HSA), this version of BIONIC will wait for the
first end-of-file indicator (EOF) after the filename is sent (the HSA sends
a yellow-ball through the network) for up to 5 minutes.  After receiving
the EOF, BIONIC enters block mode and reads data until the HSA sends the
second EOF at the end of the data.

In non-2780 mode, this version of BIONIC reads data until the base times
out (a 16 second wait with no data).  A ^Q is sent just prior to the text
message "READY FOR INPUT" and a ^S is sent after just prior to the message
"nnn RECORDS INPUT".  (Note: For non-2780 mode, there are no differences
in operation between the old version of BIONIC and this version.

Please ONTYME me with the results of your testing so that this version
may be propagated to all PDP-10 hosts.  Thank you!

To all concerned:

		    *** Merry Christmas ***

I would like to thank Mokoto Ogura for testing the new BIONIC and finding
the ILL MEM REF caused by an off-by-one oversight on my part.  This bug
has been fixed in version %1(2).  Please, I would like you to try this
new version again.  It is located on (FTSYS)BIONIC.SAV on systems 34, 55
and 57.  It is also on (SYS)BIONIC.SAV on system 24, (OHTA)BIONIC.SAV on
system 57 and (UPLKT)BIONIC.SAV on system 34.

To Phil Spies:

    The problem cited with blank records being dropped as they pass through
the HSA seems to me to be a bufferring problem.  Please take a look to see
if this in in the HSA code.  (Multiple <irs>'s).

To Mokoto Ogura:

    This should solve the ILL MEM REF problem you saw.  (The ILL MEM REF
occurred after you had already processed 4 data pages and was the next
data byte on the 5th page).  It will not solve the problem of "blank"
lines, i.e. <stx>data<irs><irs>data... (see note to Phil Spies).  Please
make a test on both system 24 and your production system(s).  I do not
know what is causing of the "BLOCK INPUT ERROR", but I have noticed that
it occurs consistantly only the "first" time I try to run BIONIC.  Every
additional time,  BIONIC works ok.


    Let me know the results of any further testing.  Thank you all.

        Tried by (FTSYS)BIONIC on C34 and by (SYS)BIONIC on C24. 
     
        In both code, the situation seems to return to the last  
        Saturday's which I mentioned in my OnTyme (A88226). 
        Any command for the BIONIC on (FTSYS:34) or (SYS:24)
        can't be accepted, and the BIONIC replys "Unrecognized command ...."    
        for any input at "*" prompt.    
     
     
Carl, I beleave you had already tested it well, especially via Async. 
So I can't understand why such a problem appeared......
     
        By our location, by some routing of network, or by just a program  
        error ..... etc ???   
     
One question: in the BIONIC, does the same command scan routin analize
a command via Async and via HSA-Bisync,  or two routins, one for Async
and another for Bisync, are ready for the code ?  
Because I wonder why the BIONIC can recognize a command via Async and can't
do it via Bisync.   
     
     
In Japan, our office is closed during the next week by NEw Year holidays.  
However, I will ready to test it when you send another version of it. So   
please send an OnTyme to KTL.TOKYO and make a copy to KTL.OGURA, which I   
will check by appropriate timing at home.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Makoto,

  I cannot be sure how your Bisync equipment works, but it is possible
that when a line of data is transmitted, it is padded to a standard size
such as 80.

  I simulated this action with BIONIC version %1(2) by adding blanks to
the end of my command line.  I also received "Unrecognized command,...".

  There is now a new version, %1(3), which contains code to remove both
leading and trailing blanks from the command line.  Please test this new
version when you have time.  It is in all the proper places on systems
34 (FTSYS)(UPLKT), 55 (FTSYS), 57 (FTSYS)(OHTA) and 24 (SYS).

  *** Have a happy New Year Holiday ***

Subject: XEXEC Progress 

Amidst all the clamour of BIONIC the past few weeks, little has been
done actively on XEXEC.  I do however have some good news to report.
The wheels kept turning, working on the various solutions to each of
the most pressing problems.

XEXEC now properly handles :ESCAPE, including "." or "-" in column 1
without clearing the frame (as in PCOM).  The problem with LOGOUT is
fixed.  (In fact, it takes a few seconds after completion before the
circuit zap is received... rather nice, I think).  Asynchronous data
flow to and from the PTY ports, and their associated command and log
files appears to work as smoothly as possible.

The remaining work that must be done, (other than general cleanup of
some of the older code), is in the scheduling routines and fitting a
sense of time-zones into Helge's date and time code.

Oh yes, and fitting Helge's modified code into XEXEC to reschedule a
job for the next runtime.

When this is done, I will have an alpha-test product for release.

Yes, I know I'm (we're) supposed to be on vacation.  Somebody forgot to

Carl,
     
This morning, I tried your new BIONIC.  
     
Via Async 
--------- 
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (UPLKT)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
        I tried 11 times in one session and got ...    
     
        6 trials : Ok (1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th trial)  
        5 trials : Not Ok with BLOCK INPUT ERROR. 
                               0 RECORDS INPUT.   
     
        And I found the sequence of OK/NOT-OK is the same as yesterday's.  
        However I don't know the sequence has some meaning or not ....
     
Via HSA   
--------  
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (UPLKT)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
        I tried 10 times and  
     
        5 trials : Ok    
        5 trials : Not Ok    After EOT sending from terminal,    
                             the host replys nothing.  
     
        - "Ambigious command ......" message 
     
          When terminal send R (UPLKT)BIONIC with some trailing blanks,    
          BIONIC replys above message as follows. 
     
     
          Terminal sends 
     
          <Stx>R (UPLKT)BIONIC<Igs><7F><Igs><42><Irs><Etx>  
     
          Response from node(host), echo and others    
     
          <Stx>R (UPLKT)BIONIC<--- 56 blanks ----><irs> *        <irs>Ambi 
          gious command, please re-enter.<irs>*<irs><etx>   
     
     
          I also know that, in the New BIONIC, blank(s) input at "*" prompt
          causes the message. 
     
          This is not a problem for my current operation, but how can I    
          understand it ???   
     
     
        - In evry NOT-OK case, I can close the BIONIC by additional   
          operation as follows.    
     
          Term     Last data record ... <irs><etx>       <eot>   
          Node                                     <ack>        ..... 
     
                ....... No response from node .......  
     
          After 10 min.  
     
          Term    <enq>      <stx><-- 80bytes record --><irs>      <eot>   
          node          <ack>                                <ack>    
     
          So I send one more dummy text after actual data, BIONIC closed.  
     
          I don't know about the ball-logic, but I guess, in somewhere,    
          the first EOT is eaten by someone and BIONIC does not know  
          about it. 
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Subject: system 39 username purge 

Someone in NTD sent validations a request to delete a list of users not
in NTD.  The list was in progress when Bill Soley noticed that (SPL) had
disappeared and he went to validations and stopped the purge...  I went
to check on 39 and found username (CARL) gone, and called validations to
see what happenned.

In all, 12 GAN 3 usernames were purged.  Bill and I made a list and gave
it to Jan Krivanek to have the accounts restored.  So, if you notice that
things on 39 are missing, ** Don't Panic ***,  they are being restored.

Of concern were: (BRING), (CARL), (DENCOFF), (FLETCHERC), (HELGEM), (JMS),
(SPL) and (TSUCOOP).  There were others, but of no consequence.

Jan assured me that she would put in the batch rquests to have operations
restore the file that were deleted.

Subject: Bionic %1(6) test release 

Makoto,

    I have fixed the problem of blank records causing an error message
when entering commands to BIONIC.  I believe that I have also solved the
problem behind the "BLOCK INPUT ERROR." message.  Apparently some things
do NOT work as they are documented to work.

    I have put my newest trial version, %1(6) [version 1, edit 6] in the
(FTSYS) directory on systems 34, 55 and 57, in the (SYS) directory on 24,
in the (UPLKT) directory on 34 and in the (OHTA) directory on 57.

    Please run your tests on this version on systems 24 and your production
systems.  If the tests are successful, then I will release this version to
the (SYS) directory as soon as possible.  If the tests fail, then I would
like you to run your tests on another internal system which has a different
type of TYMNET-II base.

    Thank you very much for your attention and co-operation.

    ****  Happy New Year Holidays ****

Congratulations on a sleuthing job well done in discovering that the

to follow up and see if the problem persists after the new version of
base code gets loaded.

Keep up the good work!

Carl,
     
Today, I tried your new BIONIC in UPLKT:34 through HSA, and found interesting   
matter.   
     
- I made trials under following 2 methods.   
     
        Method-1 : Send data , which you can see (OGURA:34)TEST.128, 128 char   
                   * 100 recs, with blank compression (by Igs).  
                   This file contains 2 all-blank records which are   
                   compressed as   
     
                        <Igs><7F><Igs><7F><Igs><42><Irs>    
     
                   per a record.     (Total 128 blanks/rec) 
     
                   In past 2 weeks, I tried under this method.   
     
        Method-2 : Send the same file with truncating traling blanks. 
                   Under this method, the all-blank record is sent as single    
     
                        <Irs> 
     
- And as far as I know, Phil's OnTyme (I95298) is not reflected for KTL's  
 HSA yet. 
     
     
At the trial   
     
In method-1     5 trials 
-----------    
     
        2 trials : Ok    
        3 trials : fail with the same situation which I mentioned in my OnTyme  
                    A90038, 28-Dec-85. (No reply from node after data sending)  
     
In method-2     10 trials
-----------    
     
        Every trial is OK !!     However the all-blank records are ignored.
     
So, from the observation, I thought IGS cause some problem, and I tried    
another data which did not contain blank compression. You can see the file 
(OGURA:34)TEST2.128, 128 char * 100 recs.    
However it was not OK. BIONIC did not reply after data sending. So IGS may not  
be a cause of the problem.    
     
Then I guess a single IRS has some meaning at Terminal-BSC-HSA-Base-BIONIC ???!!
And please remember my OnTyme (A88428,23-dec-85), in which I reported the  
same experience under katakana mode of your BIONIC.    
     
However, I'm not sure, in this kind of problem, what number of trials is enough 
for the test. Even in the method-2, I don't know 11th trial may fail or not.    
     
     
And I also tried (UPLKT:34)BIONIC via async 10 times, and found every trial
was OK. I didnot experience which I got in past trials via async.
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

The EUE stopcode was caused by FILIO trying to start I/O to unit 340.
Since only 20 disk unit blocks are defined, it picked up garbage as a
dispatch address of PUSHJed to it.  I haven't yet determined why the
PGY table had that unit number in it.     /JMS

Subject: BIONIC %1(6) Release 

Greg,
  After the last set of messages and my own testing, I feel that the
current version, %1(6) of BIONIC solves all of the known problems on
the PDP-10 side of the DEV-BISYNC-HSA-BASE-HOST-BIONIC connection.

It does not address the one request from Kamoto Ogura that all messages
be in UPPER CASE.  That will be fixed in release %1(7) which I will put
into (FTSYS) after we are sure that all the HSA concerns are fixed and
their new code is running in all the HSAs.

I believe that anyone using BIONIC from (SYS) is still using the oldest
version which I DO NOT expect to work properly.  We need to agree on
whether the new version can be placed in (SYS) before I have it released.

I want to avoid the problems and complaints that occurred with the first
test version %1(1) that was put on (SYS) by customer request.  So, let
me know and I will put version %1(7) out for final testing before its
release.

Carl,
     
This evening, I got your letter, A95887.  Regarding the Ontyme,  
please remember my OnTyme A93053 which was sent at 05-Jan and I reported no-    
close problem at %1(6) in that Ontyme.  
     
To make sure, just before I tried (UPLKT)BIONIC, it is still %1(6) !!, at our   
RWS and got the same problem which meant that BIONIC did not close the
specified file after sending completion, at the first trial.
     
So we still have a problem at BIONIC operation, however I don't know the   
problem is in BIONIC or it hide behind DEV-BISYNC-HSA-BASE-HOST connection.
     
Anyway what I can just know is BIONIC worked without problem at the last   
summer, and now BIONIC still does not work normally, and    
our boat is sinking day by day.    
     
However I think release of %1(6) may not cause worse situation than the    
current one.   
     
Best regards,

Kl10 smp system in st. louis has been down since Monday January 6th 
and Ray Donahue is working on it.  Would you call Brett Fairchild
at 314/233-4849 just to talk with him about problems and possible
to talk with Donahue?

Also, according to Ted Atkinson SMP only supports 4 front ends.
Is that true according to your understanding?  Brett wants to 
add a DN20 with leased lines for remote concentrators but has
been told that will exceed the maximum allowable number of 
frontends.

Subject: FEs on dual KL. 

The dual KL in St. Louis currently has 6 front-ends, 5 of which are active
(the 6th is used only if one KL is down).

TOPS-10 supports 8 front-ends, 4 per CPU in a dual system.

CPU0 DTE0 = RSX20F console front end on the "boot" CPU
CPU0 DTE1 = DN87S  ASYNC interface for ANF10 network (connected to TYMNET)
CPU0 DTE2 = DN61S  IBM BISYNC line (only this one on CPU0 works in 7.01)
CPU0 DTE3 = available, can be a DN20 acting as a DN87S or talking to a DN200
CPU1 DTE0 = RSX20F console front end on the "slave" CPU
CPU1 DTE1 = DN87S  ASYNC interface for ANF10 network (connected to TYMNET)
CPU1 DTE2 = DN61S  IBM BISYNC (TOPS10 7.01 cannot access DN61 in CPU1)
CPU1 DTE3 = available, can be a DN20 acting as a DN87S or talking to a DN200

The dual KL can have two more front ends connected to it, but that is not
necessary.  You can run a leased line from either DN87S to a remote
concentrator.

	 +======+======+	+======+
to IBM --|DN61 0| KL 0 |	| KL 1 |
	 +======+======+  (C)	+======+
		|DN87 0|--------|DN87 1|
		+=.==.=+	+=.==.=+
		 /    \		 /    \
             (D)/      \(A)  (B)/      \(E)
	       /	\      /	\
	leased line    +=.====.=+    leased line
		       |TYMCOMs |
		       +========+

Link (A) consists of 32 async lines connected to TYMNET.  Link (B) is 24 lines.
Line (C) is a sync line which allows link (B) to continue working even if KL 1
goes down, and allows link (A) to continue working even if KL 0 goes down.
(Link (C) was not installed in October, and should be run from one DQ11 to the
other.)  Each DN87 can have up to 12 sync lines (DQ11).  The sync lines can
be connected to a DN80, DN81, DN82, DN200, or to another DN87.

I recommend sync lines between all the DN87s in St. Louis and to any new
remote concentrator.  The link between DEC1 and DEC2 would allow files to
be transferred over the network (instead of having to write them to tape).

  we need to get together and make a list of feature tests and what the
bit designations are for things that exist now, and things that we plan

putting together programs which will run on the old and new versions of
the monitor without having to do strange things to see if things exist!

Symptom:  PJ not running, in ^C state.

Problem:  PJ running LOGINN in ^C state.  Apparently it never ran the
          init program and went to an EXIT someplace?  When I logged-in
          I experienced tha same problem.  I typed ^C^C and then took
          a look at PJ.

Solution: I built a circuit to PJ:34 and was asked to attach, which I
          did.  I then logged out PJ and built another circuit.  The
          second time it ran PAM and detached like it was supposed to
          do.  Problem solved.  Cause of problem still unknowm.  I did
          check for HRE HWE BDA set on LOGINN.SHR but everything seems

Symptom:  Page i/o error on OPER.SAV and SYSTAT.SHR

Problem:  System experienced some disk errors on BPA6 earlier and the
          files (SYS)OPER.SAV, (SYS)SYSTAT.LOW, (MAGNUM)MAGNRN.SHR and
          (RCONX)I6SAFV.MR0 were marked with HRE and (SYS)011286.DAT
          was marked with BDA.

Solution: I set my SETE password and copied OPER.SAV on top of itself
          which cleared HRE (file wasn't really bad).  Same worked for
          (MAGNUM) and (RCONX) files.  I copied (SYS)SYSTAT.LOW from
          system 35 to 55.  Everything seems to be ok now.

Note:  (RCONX) is customer for Donna Kurimay, who also called OPS to
       complain.  Hopefully fixing MAGNRN and their .MR0 file also
       solved their problem. /Carl

Maintenance replaced a couple of cards in BPA6, so a bad drive was the
original cause of the HRE and BDA errors seen this morning. Since it
was known "bad" the first try was to see if the data was actually good,
which apparently worked in 3/4 cases.  /Carl

It might be a good idea to keep a 1-pack system on this 2nd F3 to use
as our "test-bed" system from scratch.  Later, after we've accomplished
this feat, the single drive can be "added" using ADDPACK in ONCDSK to
bring the system upto it's full complement of disks.

Subject   : Trials for BIONIC through revised base program on C34
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
     
At the noon of last saturday (18-Jan) in JST, I was informed by the president   
Asama, he is staying in Cupertino, that some base program of C34 was revised.   
     
Then I tried BIONIC as follows.    
     
Trial-1   
-------   
     
        18-Jan 13:30  --  14:40   (JST) 
     
        1.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC          .... OK  
        1.2  10 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC        .... OK  
        1.3  10 trials for (UPLKT:34)BIONIC        .... OK  
        1.4  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC          .... OK  
     
        I thought a base program of C57 was not revised yet. So I checked  
        the difference between revised-base and not-revised-base.
        However both had the same conclusion.
        And I didn't know (FTSYS:34)BIONIC was the same one as (UPLKT:34)BIONIC,
        which is %1(6). So I checked the UPLKT's. 
     
trial-2   
--------  
     
        18-Jan  17:05  --  17:20    (JST)    
     
        2.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC        ..... ok   
        2.2  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC        ..... ok   
     
     
Trial-3   
--------  
     
        20-Jan  9:20  --  10:30      (JST)   
     
        3.1  5 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC
                3 trials ( from the 1st to the 3rd ) was not OK. 
                In every trial, BIONIC closed normally but some data was lost.  
                2 trials were OK.  
        3.2  5 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC         ..... OK 
        3.3  5 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC           ..... OK 
     
Trial-4   
-------   
     
        20-Jan  18:30  --  22:00  (JST) 
     
        4.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC    
                1 trial (the 3rd trial) was not OK. BIONIC closed but some 
                data was lost.
                9 trials were OK.  
        4.2  10 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC          .....OK
        4.3  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC    
                1 trial (the 3rd trial) was not OK. BIONIC closed, but some data
                was lost.
                9 trials were OK.  
     
     
From the observation of the trials, every BONIC(SYS:34,FTSYS:34,UPLKT:34, and   
SYS:57) seems to be closed normally and I think the current situation is a bit  
better than the last week's, however it is not enough to say the problem   
is fixed. 
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

I've looked at the code, found something fishy, but since it's some

worse than it is now.  I have a couple of ideas, but I'm too woosy
to pursue them at the moment.  I'll send mail when it's fixed.  the
problem is in the part that changes the schedule using the data in
ONCALL.SCH, (sigh)!

Subject: ONCALL working again 

I moved some code and that seemed to fix the problem (assuming that it
didn't cause some other more obscure problem).  Anyway, it defaults the
list from ONCALL.RES in the proper order, and when ONCALL.SCH exists it
builds the table in the order Joe,Osman,Carl.  So, at the moment, I've
copied the .SCH file as .SCN so we get Joe,Carl,Osman which is the order
that we're using for the moment.

It may work to actually schedule in the .SCH file the correct order and
let it take it from there....

Subject: 24XP14 works. 

Tracy's diagnostics wrote over part of SYS, I had to refresh the pack
(but only restores SYS, no others UFDs).  The /P14 monitor correctly
identifies what type of disk it is talking to, I currently have it
set to ignore the blocks pack.  I used the old BOOTS to load the new BOOTS,
the new one comes up, but can't read any disk.  

Either there is something with the paper-tape punch on 57, or PTPSER is
sending extra nulls.  I could not get the old BOTLOD program to punch
out an exact duplicate of the current papertape bootstrap.
Therefore I cannot create a new BOTLOD tape for testing.
I will try the PTP on 22 and 70 next.

I found another reason why DSKCLN needs to be run by the monitor 
instead of by INITIA - if (OPER)[1,21].UFD is bad, INITIA dies
and does not run DSKCLN, therefore the UFD does not get fixed.
Its even wors when the STRUUO causes a stopcode - you can't even GFD
to OPER.  I had to delete  the UFD by hand.


DSKCLN then ran, and said that (SYS)CRA003.SAV had lost data.
The monitor does not handle lost data well, when COPYCRASH tried to
LOOKUP CRA003.SAV, FILIO hung.  All PI's disabled, PI 3
currently in progress, IO bus request on PI 1, program request on PI 7.

I will probably go straight to CUP-C tomorrow (Thursday).

Subject: 3650 status 

I have a hacked version of BOOTS (named BOOTX) that reads from pages
packs only.  It works, but currently it is read from the blocks pack,
then it reads the monitor from the pages pack.  

The paper-tape punch on C70 works, I have some more debugginf go do
on BOTLOD.

Talked to Fred Wright at Systems Concepts, he says that the 3350's
cannot be completely reformatted by outputing a predetermined string
of bytes like the 3330's.  To rewrite the HA (home Address), you have to
read the existing HA, read the sense bytes from that read, merge the
sense byte data with the new HA data, then rewrite the HA.

He also mentioned that the location CRECL has the numbers of words per
record.  Setting it to 1000 will format the pack in paged.  
Unfortunately that causes a length error unless a cople of locations are
kludged up.  I haven't tried the kludge yet.

I formatted all but 3 disks, and will try creating a 10-pack system.

Subject: New F3 status 

The line from node 3143 has been cut & strung... Dennis Ernst is going
to build us code as node 2770 (same as 2770 connected to 6657!) with
host number 118.  When TYMNET gets around to giving us a new node and
host and line from one of the engines, we will consider reconfiguring
everything.  (Dennis Coffey estimates 3 weeks on that, I'd say a month).

The 2770 code should have been finished friday afternoon.  Just before
I left for the evening, I plugged in the cable to the DxP-11 card in
the NETCON box and realized we needed a cross-over of some sort...  On
Monday (today) we can find the right cross-over, build a monitor, try
to load 2770 and if everything works, build a 2 or 3 pack system.

Due to concern over the E-BUS crashes Dallas (Marconi) called and wants
us to quickly look at the dumps and then have the files removed to get
some disk space back.

   *** PLEASE, DO NOT DELETE THEM WITHOUT TALKING TO ME /CARL ***

Also, Marconi asked me to cut /P monitors for all the Dallas machines
due to pressure from Bill Fisher (spelling?).  I told him that we would
build them, put in the appropriate patches and dispatch them to the
systems sometime beginning Monday (today).  I vote that all STOPCDs on
the dallas machines cause a reload after the message is typed.  Once we
find a solution to the DIEREH/CRASH/147 crashes we can release a new
version of the monitor.

I expect to be in by noon... if anyone needs me earlier, feel free to
call me and wake me.

Subject: Node 2770 up! 

I finally got node 2770 up and running.  I swapped hardware around with
Dennis' blessing and he re-cut code for it with the swapped hardware. I
put the DUV-11 board from node 555 in place of the MDB DUV-11 look-alike
and replaced the M9400 (REV11-A) bootstrap with the M8012 BDV11 board
from the 2-cabinet micronode.  I found another DUV cable and used that
while trying to find out why it wasn't loading.

Turns out it's supposed to be plugged into slot 3 (0,1,2,3 : 4th) from the
left (and not from the right) on node 3143.

We need to do the following:

    1)  Make a new monitor for system X118 with ^D33 ports.
    2)  Make a TITO save tape.
    3)  Make sure the disks are formatted (I think they are).
    4)  Define a 2 or 3 pack structure.  I vote for 3.
    5)  Refresh & rebuild it from 930's all-files tape, selected directories.

Joe,
  Any reason P15 shouldn't work?  If not, it's ready to go.
If so, then we should simply build a /P from sources in (OSP).
Either a monitor tape, or just copy it across with TITO, then
we can bring the other system up on the network.

When loading, there were lots and lots of "lost" packets according
to the LOADII program.  I donno if that means we have a flakey line
or not.  We'll find out later.

System 118 is being rebuilt from 930's last all-files tapes made by OSMAN
this past week-end.  Whomever come in earliest, please put up the next
tape(s) and continue the restore.

The plan is to make a duplicate 930 file structure, then to delete all
the monitor sources from 118 and delete all the applications sources that
are on 930 (leaving them on 118).  There of course, will be some small
duplication, but that chan be pared down as time goes by.

Subject: PDP-10 SCNSER BUG 

It's "official", that one of the major causes of the base crashing at
the moment is caused by a timing problem in SCNSER.  What happens is
this:

  o  The user sends a BLOCK-IO OUTPUT request at PDP-10 UUO level.
  o  The circuit gets zapped out in the network.
  o  The base tells us via the input ring that the port is zapped.
  o  The monitor clears out the LDB for the port and flags that a
     zapper needs to be echoed.
  o  The monitor now goes to process the BLOCK-IO OUTPUT at SCNSER
     interrupt level, picks up the BLOCK-IO output buffer address
     (which incidently has been zeroed by the circuit zap code)
     and proceeds to build an output message using 16 bits of the
     port LDB address as the character count and 6 as the buffer
     address.
  o  The base tries to process this message and gets itself crashed
     by ISIS after messing up the rings with an incredibly large
     message.
  o  In the process of going down, the base "sometimes" takes the 10
     down; other times the 10 is crashed by DEP 1 in 30.

This is NOT a new bug.  It has been happenning for quite a while.  The
Varian base used to attempt to process this and generally went on it's
merry way after outputting only a single byte (most probably a null).
This bug has caused crashes in every version of our monitor running with
the new bases.

The fix is for the PDP-10 to NOT put the bad message type into the ORING
by making additional checks at interrupt level to determine whether the
port has been zapped since the BLOCK-IO OUTPUT request was issued, but
prior to the actual data transfer.

Subject: BIO-ZAP patch 

I've made patch #9, BIOZAP.PAT and installed it on systems C26 & D25
both in SYSTEM.SAV and the running monitor.  The patch addresses two
areas:
  1) STOPCD if T3/ LDBBIO(U) = 0 and a zapper was not seen
                                 if seen, then act if no room for data
     simulates STOPCD(DEBUG,BIOZAP)

  2) GETBIO routine ought to check if the port it's allocating a buffer
     on is really there (not zapped).

If C26 & D25 seem to run "clean" then I will propagate the patch to all
the other systems and fit the fix into the sources.

Subject: BPXKON is stupid. 

It's so dumb that it treats "RECORD NO FOUND" as if it were a bad spot on the
disk, and blithely assumes that the record will reappear if it waits long
enough.

The problem that kept ASP restore from working is the same one that caused
"I/O error to page 124" when I tried to "SAVE (SYS)NEWMON" on C24.

If FILIO tries to output more than 21 contiguous core pages to contiguous
disk pages, BPXKON has to split the request up into 3 or more requests of
7 pages each (7 pages per track).  The routine that does this made a bad
assumption.  Since the size of the command list area is big enough to handle
one cylinder on a 3330 in blocks (1 cyl = 380 blocks), then it thought it
could use the amount of space remaining in the command list to calculate the
end-of-cylinder boundry.  But 380 pages is 1.8 cylinders on a 3650 (and 4.0
cylinders on a 3330 in pages).  It correctly built the command list to transfer
pages 1-7 of track 0, 1-7 of track 1, 1-7 of track 2, but then added 8-10 of
track 2.  The disk complained that record 8 does not exist, but stupid BPXKON
treated it like a bad spot on the disk.

A three-line patch to BPXKON solved this problem.

An ASP dump stores the first 317 cylinders on one tape and 238 on the 2nd (total
of 555 cylinders).  An ASP restore takes 26 minutes, including the time it takes
to rewind the tape and mount the second one.

/JMS

P.S. The old copy routine in PAKCP5 ("OLDC" and "DOIT") works, takes somewhere
between 25 and 30 minutes to copy one 3650 pack (I wasn't watching when it
finished).

Subject: ADDPAK vs REFRESH 

Joe,
  The code in ADD UNIT tests a lot of things and all go to CANTAD which
prints out the message CAN NOT ADD UNIT TO STRUCTURE.  However, I suspect
that it took the error return from PAKREF.  This is because there is an
AOBJN pointer that says to read the RIB for each of the per-pack files
which were (2) SAT.SYS, HOME.SYS and now are (3) SAT.SYS, HOME.SYS and
SPAGES.SYS.  In PAKREF, at PREF2 + it says to error return if the rib is
blank... and in the OLD structures SWAP.SYS has been obliterated.  You
need to REFRESH first to setup the rib for SPAGES.SYS and then an ADDPAK
should work fine.

      The F-3's new host number:		   62
      The LSI-11 micro-Tym-Base's node number:	10115

  Note:  the physical port on 3143, to which node 10115 (the micro-Tym-Base)
      is attached doesn't matter:  in Tymnet II the engine's software
      dynamically associates the physical port number on which it finds the
      neighbor with the logical port number to which the nieghbor is assigned
      in its .TYM file.  The only time it matters is placing the clock jumpers
      on the proper sync board pins.

  We can install everything, even before Tymnet Operations cuts the changed

This headache/earache combination seems to be getting worse.  I have an
appointment at Kaiser tonight at 7:00 to see what is causing the problem.
If it doesn't get any better, there is a good chance that I will be at
home tomorrow.  (Possibly working?)

I will keep you all posted on developments.  I hope that all will be
cleared up and I'll be in as usual tomorrow.

Subject: Update on my condition 

The pain in the side of my head isn't getting much worse, but it also
isn't getting any better.  Lying down seems to decrease the frequency
and the intensity somewhat, but I don't know how much.  The doctor did
NOT find anything conclusive and told me to wait a day or two and come
back if the pain didn't go away.
  I have a dental appt this afternoon to determine if the pain is from
a cavity in one of my lower teeth... I don't think it will be, but we
will see.
  I will be working from home in the meantime... send mail or if it is
urgent feel free to call me.

  Ken, receive my apologies for answering so late to your December memo.
 
  1.  Oper names  for host 930 to  access INFO database: copying  930 INFO
      database to system 90  will not work. System 90 is  due to be defin-
      itively taken out of the network way before the end of 1986
 
      System 74 (accounting host) might be a better choice
 
      We need essentially EVERYTHING that exists in the INFO database
 
      Removing RF from 930  does not seem practical: as far  as I can tell
      this is used both to access INFO database and to access monitor code
      when weing for a replacement
 
  2.  Accessing on host 74 the Validation database: we will be using user-
      name CTOPSMGR and oper names JAY or STRATMAN (the latter to be vali-
      dated)
 
      Files accessed are: USERDB.DMS, CUSTDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS
 
  3.  Current status  of the  project: we  are running  January accounting
      cycle with your and our data in  parallel. We will let you know when
      we do not need your data any more
 
      We can  give you a royalty  report containing connect,  tru (without
      pru), pru (as a separate amount) for prime, nonprime and batch time.
 
      Please provide  a list  of royalty codes  as viewed  by MIS  and the
      relationship between each royalty code and the corresponding code in
      the TYMCOM/370  raw accounting. After reviewing the TYMCOM-370 moni-
      tor notes,  it seems that the  corresponding TYMCOM-370 code  can be
      one of the following raw accounting fields:
 
          Accounting record type 5, field  "PREMPGNM" for the royalty code
          and field "PREMPRU" for the pru amount
 
          Accounting record type 9, field "TRNSPGNM" and field "TRNSCHGS"
 
      Please indicate what kind of record layout you need for your royalty
      data
 
  I hope this answers your questions.
 
    Regards,
    Eric
 
  PS: special note  for Patrice de Beranger: the royalty  report will have
  to be  taken from your  data and sent  to Ken  BeDell. Since we  (YM and
  myself) provide you with detailed data you  are the only one in position
  to provide this report, since you do the totaling

Ken,

      Eric referred to two items to which I can (should?) provide answers:

1.)  PERP replacement:  the project is our number two priority, and should be
completed within about one month (my rough estimate--I'm not directly
involved in it at this time).  We are confident that this is poenty of time
prior to the date expiration of the 940s.

2.)  OPER license access on 930:  Eric's point about the plans to take system
90 out of the network well before the end of the year is news to me, and is a
very valid point.  Their need to access monitor code on 930 will be taken
under advisement.  No answer to this problem immediately, but soon.


      Regards,
      Dennis

          ALL ISG EMPLOYEES


          CHANGE IN TAX LAWS - TUITION REIMBURSEMENTS





    McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group (ISG) employees 
attending a college, university or other reimbursable program 
under the ISG Tuition Reimbursement benefit should be aware of a 
change in the tax law concerning tuition reimbursements.

    Code Section 127 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 
1978 and excluded tuition reimbursements from gross income.  This 
section of the Code expired on December 31, 1985 and unless a new 
Code amendment is passed or the present one extended, tuition 
reimbursements will be included in gross income and subject to tax 
withholdings beginning January 1, 1986.  As a result, tuition 
reimbursements paid to employees after January 1, 1986 will 
reflect the withholding of the appropriate amount as required by 
the law.

    There is an indication that Congress may act in early 1986 to 
reinstate the provisions of section 127.  If that occurs, ISG will 
make appropriate refunds to the affected employees.

    unnecessary  danger  to  employees,  Corporate American Express
    Cards are being reissued with the company's name omitted.

2.  The  new  Corporate  American  Express  Card will have the same
    account  number  as  the  card the employee is currently using.
    Therefore,  when  the new card is received, the card containing
    the company's name should be destroyed.

3.  The  new  Corporate American Express Card is still considered a
    corporate  card  and  all  rules and regulations governing such
    card is still in effect.

4.  The  reissuing  of all cards should be completed by 1 April 86.
    If  you  have  not  received your new card by that date, please
    contact Glenda Goodman in St. Louis at (314) 234-6898.

managed by Penny Scholl.  The Cupertino Center is managed by 
Stephen Reynolds.  The Management and Professional Development 
organization provides ISG's core management development programs 
as well as specific Human Resource development activities that are 
unique to particular Business Units.



In addition, Jori G. Alwell, Group Staff Assistant, will have 
responsibility both in Human Resources and in the Executive 
Office.  Reporting to me, Jori will continue to be responsible for 
the ISG Annual Bonus Plan and Executive Compensation matters.  In 
the Executive Office, she will assist and support Rich Schmitt, 
Executive Assistant to the Group Executive Officer in certain 
projects and tasks.

I am confident that this organization will help provide the level 
of Human Resources support that our Business Units expect and 
deserve.

The Safety of our employees is of the utmost concern to all of 
us.  We must continue to support aggressive programs aimed at 
achieving the protection of our work environment and the safety of 
everyone.

ISG Management Directive 210 Safety, states:

o   Management will provide a safe and healthy working environment 
    for employees and be responsible for compliance with Federal, 
    state, and local laws regarding employee safety.

o   All organizations will comply with the procedures established 
    by ISG Human Resources regarding industrial accidents and 
    illness to include management awareness, provisions for 
    medical assistance, forms preparation, reporting requirements, 
    etc.

We must all take the actions necessary to ensure the safety of our 
employees and prevent occupational related injury and illness.

If you are aware of any area in your organization where safety 
concerns exist, please contact your local Human Resources 
representative.  Should you need additional assistance, contact 
Corinne S. Karp of the ISG Group Human Resources in St. Louis.

Subject: BAD SYSUFD PATCH 

Correction:  The patch to turn off the weird SYS:.UFD = (UFD).UFD does
what we expected... however, we didn't expect that some old accounting
programs actually used that "feature"/"bug" and thus, we cannot patch
it at the moment.

   I went around to most of the Dallas machines with the new /P-8 monitors
and in an effort to just "get it done before I forgot again" I put the
instructiuon  "CAME T1,MFDPPN" back where it was patched out of both the
running /P-8 monitors and (SYS)NEWMON on
  27, 31, 37, 56 and 65.   Just fixed (SYS)NEWMON on 25, 72 and 79.

DID NOT FIX systems 23 and 54 since they were unavailable for some reason
at this time.  Someone (OSMAN,JOE) please check them and un-do the SYSUFD
patch:

  FILUUO$:   CHKPP1+2/ JFCL 0   <== replace with CAME T1,MFDPPN

I did NOT update P-8 to P-8 because I was in a hurry and don't feel all
that well at the moment... I was just trying to do it while it was on my
mind.

This past week just hasn't been my week.... On Saturday afternoon, I pulled

pains and nothing seems to help.   I have a 3:13 appt at Kaiser in Milptas
to have it looked at.  I don't know if I will be in tomorrow or not.. I will
let you know.

I called in my stand-by hours to Lois, via Mary G & Jon M as 12.8 as Osman
responded to the 2-3 calls while I was incapacitated...  I hope to be back
in the office as soon as possible.

Osman tells me that my latest REFSTR did not work... so I will try to look
over the new code and find out why it doesn't work right.  I may have to go
to Cupertino as wel to test it...  I'll let you all know as soon as I know
anything.
