No problem.  We remove the two-pack TYMCOM-X disks, put DSKA in 0 and DSKB in
1, then boot.  (DSKC does not have to be mounted.)  The default monitor in
SYS:SYSTEM.EXE is KS-702.  I could build a 701A monitor for the 2020 without
too much problem.			/JMS

Craig,
  To use TOPS-10, just BOOT system 95 from the DSKA and DSKB packs (DSKA
has to be in the drive with the 0 plug).  To log in, type "I" on the TYM444,
INITIA will log in a [1,2] job there.

Subject: REFSTR 

I believe it is finished.  The problem was that after running off the end
of the unit list, I didn't reset U to point at anything (let alone the first
unit) and PCBIO got upset.  I put in code to reset it, and it worked fine.
I built a 4-pack system, then disolved it, then built a 2 pack system.  I am
restoring the all-files tape to it to prove to myself that it will do all
that it's supposed to... then I will do an ADD-PACK to verify that that will
also work correctly.  I don't expect any problems.

The 2-pack system died in the middle of the all-files rebuild.  I'm not
syre why, it got an IME stopcd and I lost the crash by trying to dump it
to the "good" packs instead of the "2-pack" packs.

Anyway, It seems one of the UFD's is bad but that's all I know at the
moment. I just crashed it... will tell all more tomorrow.  /Carl

Subject: Hours... 

I will probably NOT be in early today....  I've finished a REFSTR that
works as best as the packs will let it.  (It created SPAGES.SYS just fine,
but I think DSKCLN didn't like 2 pages in the file and marked them as
holes in the rib, [I donno what it did to the pages in the SATs]).  I built
a 3-pack system, dumped a bunchof files to it from 930, and thinned the
files down a little.

There's a "working" skeleton system on 24 now... not everything works...
for example, TELECOPY works pulling, but not pushing?  May be a base bug,
but don't depend on it!  SPOOL is not expected to work, etc...

I didn't write a boots, and am not worried about it at present.... we need
to do that Osman,...  

Most of the MONITOR utility programs and such are out there...

  (SYS) has some compilers, etc, PEAK, VUE, TECO, ...RPG, PIP, DIRIT, etc.
 (FTSYS) has TECO 124a, and a few updated things, eg MACRO %53B
  (OSU) has some tools, some things that were in (WRS)
  (MPL) has more tools
 (CARL) and (JMS) have various copies of other things & DEC programs.
 (PJ) has a jOBS.DAT FILE but there is no (TYMNET) files.

Good night....

OSMAN will make an all-files of this system then overwrite it by making
the biggest 3650 system he can without wiping out our 2 1-pack systems.

Subject: (TYMNET)NODES.MAP updated for 14-bit node numbers. 

NODES.MAP is now 96 pages long - it has a 3-word entry for all 16834 possible
14-bit node numbers.  All nodes that do not have an explicit name now have
a 9-character implicit name.  The implicit name consists of a space, a hyphen,
the 5-digit node number (from 00000 to 37777), another hyphen, and another
space.  The program (TYMNET)DEFNOD does not list implicit names so that
it is easier to see the defined node names.

Now that the fully expanded NODES.MAP has been telecopied to all systems,
SYSTAT won't get into a loop anymore.  SYSTAT currently does not even attempt
to look for the name of any mode above 7777, which is OK since the base passes
only 12 bits to SCNSER (for LDBLOG).

Try running SYSTAT (with license set) on a "real" system to see the new names.

My manger (Craig Fletcher) wants to connect a VAX-780 to the network, if
the costs are within reason.  He has asked me to communicate with you about
this.  We first need to know the costs:
   1.)  the installation charge, &
   2.)  the monthly charge.

The situation is as follows:
The host would be located at our facility on Albrae St. in Fremont.
The connection to the netowrk would PROBABLY be async Tymcom.
We currently have node 06630 at the site.  This is an ISIS node, with a
tymsat slot, supporting 64 ports.  We are told by FSC that the engine has
2 extra async boards.

Please respond with your answers to Craig, as soon as possible.  If you are
not the person to handle this please pass it on to the proper person and
notify Craig who the contact person is.  Craig can be reached at:

Ok, no meeting tomorrow...
  In lieu of meeting, either Osman or I shall try to give you an update
on our progress to date.

  I believe the test worked.  Osman built a 12-pack system with 24XP19
and successfully ran with the KL.  One glitch was that the KL monitor did
not have Joe's "ignore-blocks-packs" code and it at first tried to come
up using the 1-pack blocks pack until that was powered down.  REFSTR
appears to work as expected.  One drive powered itself off and would not
spin up and that was where we were last night.  Osman will have to fill
in the rest of the info.

1. Well, today(3/6) I finally go to "Jury Duty"

2. 3650 Project for C26 is "GO" for this weekend.
   I build a 12-pack system over the weekend but,
   2 hrs after finished rebuilding the system lost
   one of the disk therefore lost the 12-pack system.

3. I am on the process of building an other 10-pack
   system, to check out disk, monitor and all the other
   utilities, pakcop, asp, tito etc..

4. I have not acounter any problems so far with disk,
   like disk errors or any utilities not doing what 
   they suppose too.

5. I will continue to rebuild and checking. I will
   do asp dump after restoring the all-files.

6  For this weekend I will assist ops for the move
   and be available for help.

I think it is because F38 has two 3672 control units and four 3673 string
controllers.  This means that 4 disks can be seeking to a new cylinder at
the same time, and 2 disks can be searching for ID= at the same time.
C24 has only 1 control unit and 2 string controllers.

Well, C26 is up and running with the "3650 DISKS"
as 10-Pack system and still have 158000 pages free.
So far, I have not discovered anything unusual except:
1) DSKCLN taking longer, 1 hr and 14 mins on KL.
2) After ASP dump, picked up 2 or 3 HDEV errors on
   most of the disks. Disks were running error  free
   during ALL-FILES restore.
3) SA10NW diagnostic tape which works when loaded on KI
   doesn't work on KL. Something we need to look into
   soon so that MAINT people have tools to work with.
   I have an idea what the problem might be, will look
   into it later.

Contrary to rumors you may be hearing, no final decision has been 
made to discontinue company matching contributions to the ISG 
Employee Savings Plan.  Our current need to cut costs, however, is 
causing us to look for ways to more closely link matching 
contributions to ISG's profitability.

I believe we can make the plan's cost more appropriate to ISG's 
current financial condition and at the same time keep it an 
attractive investment option for you.  In the coming weeks we'll be 
giving a representative sampling of employees a chance to comment 
on the various alternatives under consideration.  I'm committed not 
to make changes until we have thoughtfully looked at the plausible 
options and can select a course that serves both your needs and the 
needs of ISG.

I'll keep you posted on our progress.

Subject: 26: BPA1/BPA10 == DSKB5 

Joe,
  The reason that this happens is that the BPA1 is a left subset of
BPA10 and since there is no BPA1 at the moment (powered off) it picks
the first unit that matches... i.e. BPA10 and returns DSKB5.  As for
DSKB1 (BPA15) and DSKB11 (BPA2) both returning BPA2, again this is
doing the same thing... it's searching the physical tables for a left
subset and stops when it finds a match.  *** THIS IS A BUG ***  It
ought to check for exact matches first, then if it cannot find one
return the left subset.

  I manually checked each unit, and got the correct results in BPA
order.  SY checks using logical device names.  If Osman had not reversed
the order of the logical units and the physical units, this would never
have shown up!  Osman did a good thing!!!  It means we need to fix it
at some point.

Carl:

      It was a hardware problem.  DEC had spent the whole weekend working on
the RH-11, and cleaimed that they had fixed any problems, "so it must be
software".  Last night I talked to Bud Reinhardt, Mallenkrodt's chief
operator.  Bud told me the problem was also occurring with MAGCON!

      I told Frank Huels (Mallenkrodt's data center mgr.)  that it had to be
hardware, as you and I had discussed.  He called DEC back in this a.m.  Their
F.E.  found that one of the three new replacement boards in the RH-11 was
cracked!  He swapped it out, and they have successfully completed an all-files
backup.  We now have Huel's confidence.

Subject: 10115 (X62-base) reloaded. 

After the last time X62 came up, it was beeping waiting for the time.  The
ADM3 connected to node 10115 got no response.  So I logged into system 39,
created (MPL)RELOAD.115, and ran it.

How are we going to reload the PDP-11 microTYMbases once C39 is on BUBBNET?
Is it simply a matter of putting a Gateway command and password in RELOAD.* ?
What password will LOADII need to build a circuit to 3163 for reloading?

Subject: Reloading from 39? 

Unknown as to how that will work.... I've obsconded with a copy of SMITII
and it is in (SMITHDE) which seems to be the only place that it will run
from without logging you out.  So, if 930 & 6657 is up, we can load from
there, and after copying it to 62, we should be able to go the other way
with some ease.  TELECO works fine through the gateway, and LOADII will
go through a gateway, but I do not know the procedure.

System 57 is a backup of some fo the code on 39, but (CURR11) and (NEW11)
are not backed up anywhere as far as I know.  maybe we should also find
the reason whay we cannot load 6657 from 930... I believe it has somethng
to do with CIOPR... sigh.  History bites us again!

SUBJ:  Field Service Company's Network Access: This Building. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      I've received a phone call from Tymnet:  FSC's access to Tymnet in this
building, both for terminals and for our hosts, is not 'legal'.  I.e., Payment
Systems Co.  pays for the engines in this building and for the synchronous
network line to connect to the public network.  Pmnt. Sys. Co.  is billed by
Tymnet for this service.  We do not pay for it at all.  I am told, by Tymnet,
that our traffic "degrades Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s service", and that our use of
service purchased by another company is not allowed.

      I have discussed this with Pat Diamond, and he has agreed to handle the
solution of this problem.  He and I discussed some alternatives, and the
suggestion which he said he will persue most strongly includes:  the
installation on site here (as a 'lab' machine--self installed) of a Tymnet
Engine that FSC owns; and upgrading the line(s) (from here to Solar Way) which
Pmnt. Sys. Co.  'owns', from 9.6 Kbps to 14.4 Kbps.

      Our lab machine would be the pass-through connection for our micro-
Tym-Bases and would provide any terminal connections we might need to take off
Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engines.  The only traffic that Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engine
will have may be pass-through traffic.  We could share costs for the lines
with Pmnt. Sys. Co., connecting one line to their machine and the other to
our machine.  Pat tells me that this would probably provide service MUCH more
quickly than ordering new phone service from Pac. Tel., and--if Sal Spinelli
of Pmnt. Sys. Co. agrees--be less expensive.

      Pat tells me that he will contact Sal next week:  Sal is in Irvine this
week, but next week will be available at Tymnet, Orchard Parkway.  He will be
in meetings there next week about their network access problems, but be able
to be reached by the Tymnet operator.

Subject: Network access change: Liberty. 

      Discussion of this pending change with Joe Smith has shown this to be an
opportunity:  if we get the lab node, we could have an ISIS machine which
would allow an Async Host Interface TYMCOM slot, as well as a Async Terminal
Interface CONSAT slot.  The Host Interface slot could allow us to bring the
the 2020 (host 95) into the network quickly, plus we could put the consoles
for the hosts on them -- allowing us to use the consoles remotely (through
network sub-addressing).

      Another alternative could be connecting to the Albrae St.  location.
This could provide redundancy, if this were in addition to the lines discussed
previously.  If we order any lines, I believe ordering directly from Pac.
Tel. will will be significantly less expensive than ordering from Tymnet.
Tymnet's monthly charge for service between here and Solar Way:  Tymnet's
monthly charge would be over $700 -- the advantage they offer is Tymnet
Network Control's reporting of and follow up on the line outage.

      Pat suggested another cost-saving alternative for redundancy from our
engine to the network:  a dial-up Network sync line, rather than a 4-wire
dedicated line.

Subject: Using the GATEWAY command in TELECOPY. 

To TELECOPY files to or from system 39, you have to start on a PDP-10 on the
public net, build a gateway to BUBBNET, then copy the files.  The host numbers
of the gateways are: 5946, 1461, 1579, 5516, 5981, 1552, 2866, 3171, and 7255.
For example:

	.R TELECOPY
	: GATEWAY 7255;JMS:39
	Password <password for JMS on BUBBNET>
	: (*6NEWS:39)TELECO.DOC,(JMS:930)		;Pull a file from 39
	: (JMS:930)SWITCH.INI,:39			;Push a file to 39
	: QUIT

The gateway host numbers are listed in (*6NEWS)BUBNET.DOC on most PDP-10 systems.

Subject: 3650 disk project. 

Remaining items in the 3650 project:                    17-Mar-86

1) Verify that APT10 works.  It is designed to transfer files between the
   TYMCOM-X system and KLDCP DECtapes via the CTY.  Use it to put SA10NW on
   a DECtape.   This requires a standalone KL, brought up in CONSOLE mode.

2) Determine why the paper-tape version of BOTLOD does not work like the version
   in MONBTS.  This requires a standalone KI with 3650 disks for complete veri-
   fication, although most of the work could be done on C24 with Ampex disks.

3) After the KI version of BOTLOD works, put the KL version on the DECtapes
   using APT10.  This can be done during a scheduled downtime.

4) Determine where PAKCP5 fails when writing the secondary HOM and BAT pages.
   This is the only thing keeping the COPY command from working.  This requires
   standalone time on the CPU with 3650 disks, not more than one weekend.

5) Make a single version of PAKCOPY that understands 3675 in blocks and pages.
   This means that the size of the areas used for channel command lists need to
   be determined at run time, not as an assembly option.  This can be done on
   C24 with Ampex disks.

6) Locate the routines in the monitor that assume that all units of a structure
   are the same size.  Determine whether it is feasible to have a DSKB composed
   of a mixture of packs formatted in blocks and in pages.

7) Modify BOOTS to understand all 4 disk types.  Right now, "BOOTS" understands
   3675 blocks only, and "BOOTX" understands 3650 pages only.  This requires
   standalone time on C24 with Ampex disks, and can be verified on C26
   during a scheduled reload of the system.

8) Add a command to BOOTS telling it which set of packs to look at.  This is so
   that a one-pack test system can be kept spinning and not confuse the Monitor
   by having two packs claiming to be "DSKB0".  This will have a side effect of
   making BOOTS much faster in loading the monitor, and can be done on 930.

9) Install 2nd upgraded SA10 for continued testing on C24.

10) Add code to PAKCP5 that can rewrite HA/R0 on 3650.  I have disassembled the
   relevant portions of SA10NW.SAV, and will put them in PAKCOP.MAC.  Testing
   requires days of standalone time on C24 with new SA10 and 3650 disks.

11) Merge PAKCP5 with the pages version of 3675 PAKCOP.

12) Determine whether bad blocks really work.  Verify that PAKCOPY assigns
    alternate tracks correctly.  Make it look at the BAT block that SA10NW
    creates.  Make the monitor add new entries when it discovers bad pages.

It might be a nice idea to "read-only" blocks and "write-only" pages with
a version of PAKCOP... Yes, I realize we will have extra pages after just
such a transfer, and that SAT.SYS would need to be fixed up, but it might
well be worth doing the formatting to pages and using only the same size
in blocks until the next REFRESH. That way, we save having to do a reformat
and a full-rebuild at the same time.

I believe it is finished.  The problem was that after running off the end
of the unit list, I didn't reset U to point at anything (let alone the first
unit) and PCBIO got upset.  I put in code to reset it, and it worked fine.
I built a 4-pack system, then disolved it, then built a 2 pack system.  I am
restoring the all-files tape to it to prove to myself that it will do all
that it's supposed to... then I will do an ADD-PACK to verify that that will
also work correctly.  I don't expect any problems.

I will probably NOT be in early today....  I've finished a REFSTR that
works as best as the packs will let it.  (It created SPAGES.SYS just fine,
but I think DSKCLN didn't like 2 pages in the file and marked them as
holes in the rib, [I donno what it did to the pages in the SATs]).  I built
a 3-pack system, dumped a bunchof files to it from 930, and thinned the
files down a little.

There's a "working" skeleton system on 24 now... not everything works...
for example, TELECOPY works pulling, but not pushing?  May be a base bug,
but don't depend on it!  SPOOL is not expected to work, etc...

  (MPL) has more tools
 (CARL) and (JMS) have various copies of other things & DEC programs.
 (PJ) has a jOBS.DAT FILE but there is no (TYMNET) files.

Good night....

OSMAN will make an all-files of this system then overwrite it by making
the biggest 3650 system he can without wiping out our 2 1-pack systems.

Subject: (TYMNET)NODES.MAP updated for 14-bit node numbers. 

NODES.MAP is now 96 pages long - it has a 3-word entry for all 16834 possible
14-bit node numbers.  All nodes that do not have an explicit name now have
a 9-character implicit name.  The implicit name consists of a space, a hyphen,
the 5-digit node number (from 00000 to 37777), another hyphen, and another
space.  The program (TYMNET)DEFNOD does not list implicit names so that
it is easier to see the defined node names.

Now that the fully expanded NODES.MAP has been telecopied to all systems,
SYSTAT won't get into a loop anymore.  SYSTAT currently does not even attempt
to look for the name of any mode above 7777, which is OK since the base passes
only 12 bits to SCNSER (for LDBLOG).

Try running SYSTAT (with license set) on a "real" system to see the new names.

My manger (Craig Fletcher) wants to connect a VAX-780 to the network, if
the costs are within reason.  He has asked me to communicate with you about
this.  We first need to know the costs:
   1.)  the installation charge, &
   2.)  the monthly charge.

The situation is as follows:
The host would be located at our facility on Albrae St. in Fremont.
The connection to the netowrk would PROBABLY be async Tymcom.
We currently have node 06630 at the site.  This is an ISIS node, with a
tymsat slot, supporting 64 ports.  We are told by FSC that the engine has
2 extra async boards.

Please respond with your answers to Craig, as soon as possible.  If you are
not the person to handle this please pass it on to the proper person and
notify Craig who the contact person is.  Craig can be reached at:

Ok, no meeting tomorrow...
  In lieu of meeting, either Osman or I shall try to give you an update

  I believe the test worked.  Osman built a 12-pack system with 24XP19
and successfully ran with the KL.  One glitch was that the KL monitor did
not have Joe's "ignore-blocks-packs" code and it at first tried to come
up using the 1-pack blocks pack until that was powered down.  REFSTR
appears to work as expected.  One drive powered itself off and would not
spin up and that was where we were last night.  Osman will have to fill
in the rest of the info.

Subject: 3650 Project & This weekend.. 

1. Well, today(3/6) I finally go to "Jury Duty"

2. 3650 Project for C26 is "GO" for this weekend.
   I build a 12-pack system over the weekend but,
   2 hrs after finished rebuilding the system lost
   one of the disk therefore lost the 12-pack system.

3. I am on the process of building an other 10-pack
   system, to check out disk, monitor and all the other
   utilities, pakcop, asp, tito etc..

4. I have not acounter any problems so far with disk,
   like disk errors or any utilities not doing what 
   they suppose too.

5. I will continue to rebuild and checking. I will
   do asp dump after restoring the all-files.

6  For this weekend I will assist ops for the move
   and be available for help.

I think it is because F38 has two 3672 control units and four 3673 string
controllers.  This means that 4 disks can be seeking to a new cylinder at
the same time, and 2 disks can be searching for ID= at the same time.
C24 has only 1 control unit and 2 string controllers.

Well, C26 is up and running with the "3650 DISKS"
as 10-Pack system and still have 158000 pages free.
So far, I have not discovered anything unusual except:
1) DSKCLN taking longer, 1 hr and 14 mins on KL.
2) After ASP dump, picked up 2 or 3 HDEV errors on
   most of the disks. Disks were running error  free
   during ALL-FILES restore.
3) SA10NW diagnostic tape which works when loaded on KI
   doesn't work on KL. Something we need to look into
   soon so that MAINT people have tools to work with.
   I have an idea what the problem might be, will look
   into it later.

          COMPANY AND DISSOLUTION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
          DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS COMPANY


We need to do everything we can to ensure the ISG meets its 1986 
revenue and earnings objectives.  In line with this need I am 
announcing, effective today, the following organizational changes:

o   The North American Marketing and Sales organization that 
    formerly reported within McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
    Systems Company is now part of McDonnell Douglas Computer 
    Systems Company.  This restructuring will better equip the 
    Computer Systems Company to compete in the business systems 
    marketplace while it continues to meet ISG's internal hardware 
    manufacturing needs.  The restructured company will be headed 
    up by Otis Brinkley as President, with Vern Smith as Executive 
    Vice President.  In the coming weeks, Otis and Vern will work 
    together to develop an optimal structure for the Computer 
    Systems Company.

o   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company has been 
    dissolved in an effort to narrow the range of our business 
    activities and focus more on profitability.  The business 
    units within the Distribution Systems Company have been 
    reassigned as follows:

    -     Our Commercial Distribution Systems and Electronic Data 
          Interchange businesses are now part of McDonnell Douglas 
          Diversified Information Systems Company.  As such, these 
          businesses will continue to pursue their 1986 Operating 
          Plan objectives.

    -     Our embryonic Retail Systems business is being assigned 
          to ISG Marketing and Planning, where it will continue to 
          develop its strategy, though at a much lower level of 
          investment than we had planned for the balance of 1986.





1'm confident that these actions will increase our chances of 
achieving our 1986 objectives.  I'm counting on you not only to 
support these moves, but to do whatever you can to ease the 
transition for the people affected by them.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP         BENEFITS FACT     March 1986



TO:           ALL ISG EMPLOYEES WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE


SUBJECT:      (l) Coordination of Benefits
              (2) Oral Surgery Coverage For Employees
                  Covered By A Health Maintenance Organization
              (3) Toll Free 800 Numbers To Group Insurance


Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  elected medical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

On Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 9 March 1986 the parking lots
at 20605 and 20705 Valley Green (VG1, VG2 and VG3) will be
resurfaced and striped.  Those employees needing access to
these facilities should park on the south side of VG2 and
the west side of VG1 and VG2 adjacent to the lobby entrance.
All employees entering VG1 and VG2 can do so through the
front lobby entrance.  This entrance will be open 24 hours
a day during this weekend as well as the lobby to VG3.
All employees should have their vehicles moved to the
appropriate spaces no later than 5:00 AM on 8 March 1986.
Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Contrary to rumors you may be hearing, no final decision has been 
made to discontinue company matching contributions to the ISG 
Employee Savings Plan.  Our current need to cut costs, however, is 
causing us to look for ways to more closely link matching 
contributions to ISG's profitability.

I believe we can make the plan's cost more appropriate to ISG's 
current financial condition and at the same time keep it an 
attractive investment option for you.  In the coming weeks we'll be 
giving a representative sampling of employees a chance to comment 
on the various alternatives under consideration.  I'm committed not 
to make changes until we have thoughtfully looked at the plausible 
options and can select a course that serves both your needs and the 
needs of ISG.

I'll keep you posted on our progress.

Subject: 26: BPA1/BPA10 == DSKB5 

Joe,
  The reason that this happens is that the BPA1 is a left subset of
BPA10 and since there is no BPA1 at the moment (powered off) it picks
the first unit that matches... i.e. BPA10 and returns DSKB5.  As for
DSKB1 (BPA15) and DSKB11 (BPA2) both returning BPA2, again this is
doing the same thing... it's searching the physical tables for a left
subset and stops when it finds a match.  *** THIS IS A BUG ***  It
ought to check for exact matches first, then if it cannot find one
return the left subset.

  I manually checked each unit, and got the correct results in BPA
order.  SY checks using logical device names.  If Osman had not reversed
the order of the logical units and the physical units, this would never
have shown up!  Osman did a good thing!!!  It means we need to fix it
at some point.

Carl:

      It was a hardware problem.  DEC had spent the whole weekend working on
the RH-11, and cleaimed that they had fixed any problems, "so it must be
software".  Last night I talked to Bud Reinhardt, Mallenkrodt's chief
operator.  Bud told me the problem was also occurring with MAGCON!

      I told Frank Huels (Mallenkrodt's data center mgr.)  that it had to be
hardware, as you and I had discussed.  He called DEC back in this a.m.  Their
F.E.  found that one of the three new replacement boards in the RH-11 was
cracked!  He swapped it out, and they have successfully completed an all-files
backup.  We now have Huel's confidence.

After the last time X62 came up, it was beeping waiting for the time.  The
ADM3 connected to node 10115 got no response.  So I logged into system 39,
created (MPL)RELOAD.115, and ran it.

How are we going to reload the PDP-11 microTYMbases once C39 is on BUBBNET?
Is it simply a matter of putting a Gateway command and password in RELOAD.* ?
What password will LOADII need to build a circuit to 3163 for reloading?

Subject: Reloading from 39? 

Unknown as to how that will work.... I've obsconded with a copy of SMITII
and it is in (SMITHDE) which seems to be the only place that it will run
from without logging you out.  So, if 930 & 6657 is up, we can load from
there, and after copying it to 62, we should be able to go the other way
with some ease.  TELECO works fine through the gateway, and LOADII will
go through a gateway, but I do not know the procedure.

System 57 is a backup of some fo the code on 39, but (CURR11) and (NEW11)
are not backed up anywhere as far as I know.  maybe we should also find
the reason whay we cannot load 6657 from 930... I believe it has somethng
to do with CIOPR... sigh.  History bites us again!

SUBJ:  Field Service Company's Network Access: This Building. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      I've received a phone call from Tymnet:  FSC's access to Tymnet in this
building, both for terminals and for our hosts, is not 'legal'.  I.e., Payment
Systems Co.  pays for the engines in this building and for the synchronous
network line to connect to the public network.  Pmnt. Sys. Co.  is billed by
Tymnet for this service.  We do not pay for it at all.  I am told, by Tymnet,
that our traffic "degrades Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s service", and that our use of
service purchased by another company is not allowed.

      I have discussed this with Pat Diamond, and he has agreed to handle the
solution of this problem.  He and I discussed some alternatives, and the
suggestion which he said he will persue most strongly includes:  the
installation on site here (as a 'lab' machine--self installed) of a Tymnet
Engine that FSC owns; and upgrading the line(s) (from here to Solar Way) which
Pmnt. Sys. Co.  'owns', from 9.6 Kbps to 14.4 Kbps.

      Our lab machine would be the pass-through connection for our micro-
Tym-Bases and would provide any terminal connections we might need to take off
Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engines.  The only traffic that Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engine
will have may be pass-through traffic.  We could share costs for the lines
with Pmnt. Sys. Co., connecting one line to their machine and the other to
our machine.  Pat tells me that this would probably provide service MUCH more
quickly than ordering new phone service from Pac. Tel., and--if Sal Spinelli
of Pmnt. Sys. Co. agrees--be less expensive.

      Pat tells me that he will contact Sal next week:  Sal is in Irvine this
week, but next week will be available at Tymnet, Orchard Parkway.  He will be
in meetings there next week about their network access problems, but be able
to be reached by the Tymnet operator.

Subject: Network access change: Liberty. 

      Discussion of this pending change with Joe Smith has shown this to be an
opportunity:  if we get the lab node, we could have an ISIS machine which
would allow an Async Host Interface TYMCOM slot, as well as a Async Terminal
Interface CONSAT slot.  The Host Interface slot could allow us to bring the
the 2020 (host 95) into the network quickly, plus we could put the consoles
for the hosts on them -- allowing us to use the consoles remotely (through
network sub-addressing).

      Another alternative could be connecting to the Albrae St.  location.
This could provide redundancy, if this were in addition to the lines discussed
previously.  If we order any lines, I believe ordering directly from Pac.
Tel. will will be significantly less expensive than ordering from Tymnet.
Tymnet's monthly charge for service between here and Solar Way:  Tymnet's
monthly charge would be over $700 -- the advantage they offer is Tymnet
Network Control's reporting of and follow up on the line outage.

      Pat suggested another cost-saving alternative for redundancy from our
engine to the network:  a dial-up Network sync line, rather than a 4-wire
dedicated line.

One  of  the  principles  given  to us this year is to manage ISG's

a  need  to  minimize  ISG costs in the first half of the year.  To
respond  to that need we have moved the Management and Professional
Development  Phases  I-VII  provided  to  MDAIS  into the first two
quarters of 1986.

To  accomplish  this adjustment, MDAIS Phases have been substituted
for  ISG  Phases.    Subsequently, those ISG Phases scheduled after
March 17 will be deferred into the last half of the year.
 
In  addition  to  having  a  significant  favorable impact on ISG's
operating  results  for the first half of this year, the completion
dates  for  Phases  III  and V are moved forward.  As a result, the

Subject: Using the GATEWAY command in TELECOPY. 

To TELECOPY files to or from system 39, you have to start on a PDP-10 on the
public net, build a gateway to BUBBNET, then copy the files.  The host numbers
of the gateways are: 5946, 1461, 1579, 5516, 5981, 1552, 2866, 3171, and 7255.
For example:

	.R TELECOPY
	: GATEWAY 7255;JMS:39
	Password <password for JMS on BUBBNET>
	: (*6NEWS:39)TELECO.DOC,(JMS:930)		;Pull a file from 39
	: (JMS:930)SWITCH.INI,:39			;Push a file to 39
	: QUIT

The gateway host numbers are listed in (*6NEWS)BUBNET.DOC on most PDP-10 systems.

Subject: 3650 disk project. 

Remaining items in the 3650 project:                    17-Mar-86

1) Verify that APT10 works.  It is designed to transfer files between the
   TYMCOM-X system and KLDCP DECtapes via the CTY.  Use it to put SA10NW on
   a DECtape.   This requires a standalone KL, brought up in CONSOLE mode.

2) Determine why the paper-tape version of BOTLOD does not work like the version
   in MONBTS.  This requires a standalone KI with 3650 disks for complete veri-
   fication, although most of the work could be done on C24 with Ampex disks.

3) After the KI version of BOTLOD works, put the KL version on the DECtapes
   using APT10.  This can be done during a scheduled downtime.

4) Determine where PAKCP5 fails when writing the secondary HOM and BAT pages.
   This is the only thing keeping the COPY command from working.  This requires
   standalone time on the CPU with 3650 disks, not more than one weekend.

5) Make a single version of PAKCOPY that understands 3675 in blocks and pages.
   This means that the size of the areas used for channel command lists need to
   be determined at run time, not as an assembly option.  This can be done on
   C24 with Ampex disks.

6) Locate the routines in the monitor that assume that all units of a structure
   are the same size.  Determine whether it is feasible to have a DSKB composed
   of a mixture of packs formatted in blocks and in pages.

7) Modify BOOTS to understand all 4 disk types.  Right now, "BOOTS" understands
   3675 blocks only, and "BOOTX" understands 3650 pages only.  This requires
   standalone time on C24 with Ampex disks, and can be verified on C26
   during a scheduled reload of the system.

8) Add a command to BOOTS telling it which set of packs to look at.  This is so
   that a one-pack test system can be kept spinning and not confuse the Monitor
   by having two packs claiming to be "DSKB0".  This will have a side effect of
   making BOOTS much faster in loading the monitor, and can be done on 930.

9) Install 2nd upgraded SA10 for continued testing on C24.

10) Add code to PAKCP5 that can rewrite HA/R0 on 3650.  I have disassembled the
   relevant portions of SA10NW.SAV, and will put them in PAKCOP.MAC.  Testing
   requires days of standalone time on C24 with new SA10 and 3650 disks.

11) Merge PAKCP5 with the pages version of 3675 PAKCOP.

12) Determine whether bad blocks really work.  Verify that PAKCOPY assigns
    alternate tracks correctly.  Make it look at the BAT block that SA10NW
    creates.  Make the monitor add new entries when it discovers bad pages.

Subject: Re: PAKCOP 3675 blocks/pages 

It might be a nice idea to "read-only" blocks and "write-only" pages with
a version of PAKCOP... Yes, I realize we will have extra pages after just
such a transfer, and that SAT.SYS would need to be fixed up, but it might
well be worth doing the formatting to pages and using only the same size
in blocks until the next REFRESH. That way, we save having to do a reformat
and a full-rebuild at the same time.

Bill,
  This was updated to handle node numbers > 7777 for SYSTAT and it's
obvious that some programs out there need to be fixed... i.e. SCREAM
and ACSCAN... but the problem probabluy is not in the fact that the
arrays for node numbers is smaller than NODES.MAP, but that there are
people logging in from nodes larger than 7777!

%FROM: Per_Lindberg_QZ@ODEN

Have I told you about the large computer now installed and running at
Stacken, the computer club at the KTH (the Royal Institute of
Technology) in Stockholm? No? Well, then...

A few years ago, DEC (Digital Equipment Corp) in Sweden had a sort of
"white elephant" on their hands, a DECsystem-10 (the same type you are
running COM on), but a very old model with a KA10 CPU, single
transistor logic boards and good old core memory. Big as hell, lots of
blinkenlights, and with an appetite for kiloAmpere that would ruin any
computer hobbyist. The customer that had leased the thing did not want
it any more, and DEC did not even try to find another. But instead of
scrapping it, they gave it to us in Stacken. Sure, we could take care
of it, and even payed the transport (about 3000 SEK). But where would
we house such a beast? Fortunately, KTH promised us a place to run it.
For two years it was kept in a garage at KTH while we lobbyed the KTH
administration to give us that place. (There is a constant shortage of
space at KTH, alas). It was not after a new guy in Stacken, Peter
Lothberg, had renewed the efforts by pestering the Principal himself
for a while that we finally got the promised room to install it in.

Then around last spring (1985) the work started. During the summer of
1985 the place was refitted with a real raised computer room floor,
electrical power, terminal lines, a cooling machine with outdoor
condensors, and everything else needed to make the place a
full-fledged computer center.

Meanwhile, our DEC-10, now named "KATIA" (a pun on "Nadja" which is
the DEC-2020 at KTH and "KA-TIA", where "tia" is 10:er in swedish),
was temporary installed and tested at CCCC (Colossal Cave Computer
Center), Peter:s playroom where he already has a DECsystem-10 going.
That DEC-10, (named KICKI) was used for testing and debuggning Katia.
Without it, it might still be nonfunctional.

When the room was finished, Katia was moved in and re-debugged. (You
don't move such a beast without dislocating at least a few wires). And
then, one night last autumn, the champagne bottle, which had been
bought for just this reason, was opened. Katia was installed, and up
and running! According to the tradition, which begun with the
installing of Kicki a year eariler, the bottle is uncorked when you
can give the command MAKE LOVE on the console, which makes a file
named "LOVE" with the venerable TECO editor, and get the resonse "NOT
WAR?" on the console. (This is a "hack" in TECO, installed for obvious
reasons long ago, probably way back in the sixties).

Then on the 23rd of October 1985 Katia was officially inaugurated as
Stacken was throwing its first Big Party in its 7-year history, where
participants could awe at the extremely rare sight of over 100
computer hobbyists, nerds and hackers in (get this!) ties and jackets
(some of them even pinstriped!) The members and a large number of
specially invited dignitaries met at a splendid Dinner With Everything
at the KTH student corps house. Speeches were held, glasses were
raised, jokes were cracked and the atmosphere was high. After the
coffee everyone walked over to the room where Katia stood happily
humming since a few days, where the Principal inaugurated Katia by
cutting a punched tape spanned across the door.

Such a project can't be done without two things: many highly skilled
enthusiasts and a lot of money. Fortunately, Stacken had both. The
latter came from selling copies of our EMACS workalike editor "AMIS"
for about 500 USD a copy to other installations of DEC-10s, VAXen,
PR1MEs and Norsk Data. AMIS was our first success back in 1980, when
me and six others got fed up with not having a really good editor.
(I'm using it right now for writing this text). So AMIS, aside from
preventing us from going berserk, gave us the means to install Katia.

By the way, we can use more hardware. All sorts of donations are
appreciated. Especially disks, but we'll take anything that could
possibly be connected to a DECsystem-10. Also terminals, cooling
machines... anything. Send inquiries to me, or better still, to:
Datorforeningen Stacken, c/o NADA, KTH, S-10044 Stockholm, SWEDEN.

Katia is a neat hobby computer. Those kids and their daddys with
CBM-64:s can go suck on a BASIC manual. The DEC-10 is a REAL COMPUTER,
36 bit words, real tape, disks, DECtapes and a glorious collection of
blinking lights. It runs the TOPS-10 timesharing operating system, one
of the finest and most user-friendly OS ever made (it beats both VMS
and UNIX singlehandedly), rivalled only by TOPS-20. And the awesome
sight of Katia:s 12 large blue cabinets with the blinking lights, its
designed front panel and the rest of the hardware filling the room
stirs the heart. Katia looks like a computer should! This machine and
its worshippers are not unlike the phenomenon of people lovingly
restoring old steam engines and cars. But while Katia definitely is a
veteran computer, it's still modern. It outperforms a medium-sized VAX
and has a much neater instruction set. (Long live the DECsystem-10
designers!) And there are gigabytes upon gigabytes with highly
sophisticated software which we can run on it. Our only problem so far
is what to do with all those unused CPU cycles.

Anyone wants a million prime numbers?


(Text 16633)------------------------------


[Actually the MAKE LOVE trap is in COMPIL and in the old days when tops20
 exec still had the compil interface in it, you could get the not war
 response on tops20 as well. Although this code has been conditionalled out
for some time it was only with tops20 version 5 that it went alltogether.
A sad day !! To the maintainers of PCL : If goto hell on the dec10 responds
with get stuffed can't we have something like that or better under tops20 ?

South on 101 for 60 miles to San Juan Bautista, then 11 miles (another hour) to
Fremont Peak State Park.  We arrived at 4:07am; the moon was still up.  But you
could see Halley's with the naked eye.  At 4:30 the moon went down and the view
got better.  The tail of the comet took up half the field of view in 7x35
binoculars ("It looks like all the pictures of comets!").  It started to fade
at 5:00am when the sky got light.  ("We saw Halley's comet!")

Through a telescope, the field of view is too small to see the entire tail all
at the same time.  One guy had an 8-inch by 7 foot reflector - it showed the
nucleus as a distinct disk in the middle of a fuzzy spot.  And Saturn's rings
are quit spectacular even in the smaller telescopes.

The moon sets 1/29th of a day later each time, so it will still be in the sky
at 4:45 Sunday morning; that's the last time Halley's will be visible for
about 2 weeks.

         INTERCOMPANY PRICING BOARD CHANGES



    Effective  immediately,  the  charter  and  composition  of the
    Intercompany Pricing Board are changed as follows.

    The charter of the Intercompany Pricing Board is to:

    o    Establish  operational  ground  rules  and  procedures  as
         necessary to ensure effective implementation of policy.

    o    Review   and  approve  proposed  changes  to  intercompany
         Pricings.

    o    Review  operation of intercompany pricing policy, Pricings
         and  supporting  systems  and  make recommendations to ISG
         Executive  Management  as  necessary  to  ensure effective
         operation of intercompany pricing policy.

    o    Resolve    issues   relating   to   intercompany   pricing
         including,  when  appropriate,  making  recommendations to
         and obtaining approval of Executive Management.

    o    Interpret  intercompany  pricing policy as required in the
         operational environment.

    o    Determine specific handling of exceptional situations.

    o    Ensure  that decisions reached by the Intercompany Pricing
         Board  are implemented in the organizations represented by
         members of the Board.

    With  the  undersigned  as  Chairman,  the Intercompany Pricing
    Board will include the following representatives:

         Craig, S. L.:                  Payment Systems Co.
        *Donovan, J. R.:                ISG  Marketing and Planning
                                        (ex officio)
         Elbert, J. B.:                 Network Systems Co.
         Freeman, F. R.:                Information      Processing
                                        Center
         Frey, D. J.:                   Manufacturing             &
                                        Engineering Systems Co.
         Horn, E. T.:                   Government Services
         Johnson, R. W.:                Computer Systems Co.
         Kintsch, H. J.:                Field Service Co.
         Kos, J. J.:                    Health Systems Co.
        *Krone, L. H.:                  ISG     Marketing    Policy
                                        (Alternate Chairman)






             *LeCroy, E. P.:     ISG Finance
             *Mundloch, R. A.:   ISG Finance
              Schenk, R. W.:     Diversified Information Systems Co.
              Schneider, D. A:   Communications Industry Systems Co.
              Vickroy, W. R.:    Information Systems International
             *Wiedenmann, P. W.: ISG Finance (ex officio)

    Those  Pricing  Board  members  indicated  by * are also members of the
    Intercompany   Pricing  Board  Executive  Council.    This  Council  is
    established  to  provide  timely  and  efficient  resolution of pricing
    questions  at  such  times  when  business conditions do not permit the
    assembly  of  the  full  Intercompany  Pricing Board.  The Council will
    meet only as occasionally required.

    Don  W.  Gerth has successfully completed his assignment to develop the
    policy  and  supervise the implementation of ISG's intercompany pricing
    mechanism.      Without   his  energy  and  attention  to  detail,  the
    intercompany  pricing  program would not be as complete as it is today.
    Effective  14  February  1986,  Don leaves ISG Marketing and returns to
    the  McDonnell  Douglas Manufacturing Industry Systems Company.  Please
    join  me  in  expressing appreciation to Don for his outstanding effort
    over the past year.

    With   D.  W.  Gerth's  departure,  responsibility  for  the  continued
    operation  of  Intercompany  Pricing  is  transferred  to ISG Marketing
    Policy,  the  focal point for Intercompany Pricing administration.  All
    future  intercompany pricing matters should be addressed to L. H. Krone
    (I014/301/4E; Phone:  314-233-0002, ONTYME:  ISGHQ.L/KRONE).
    Your continued cooperation will be appreciated.

Subject: LOGON and SWITCH.INI 

It is "nice" that LOGON will let you select options based on node-port
or simply node.  TYMNET nodes on the otherhand do NOT, (I repeat, do NOT)_,
report the physical port number anymore.  Not just the micro-nodes... all
TYMNET nodes are that way...  so, physical port number is meaningless in
99.9 percent of the cases.  (On a micronode,connected to a host, it has a
little meaning, by co-incidence).  The port reported is more likely the
circuit number reported to ISIS (or it's look-alikes).

So,  please don't feel that you are having problems with LOGON if you
cannot get it to select on a specific port.  TYMNET isn't really reporting
the physical port to the host anymore.  The Node information IS correct if
you are coming from a real node, and sometimes is a lie for internal circuits
on a micro-node host.  All "real" circuits, are supposed to be correct.

Sigh!

30-Mar-85 10:18/JMS
Contact:  Fremont Ops, Elisha Padilla, (415)498-2588, System 28.

Symptom:  SPOOL not running, SPLFIX gets a fatal error on file SPOOL.GBK
        Renaming files, wait...
        LOOKUP failed for (SPOOL)SPOOL.GBK.
        Fatal error.
        Enabling SPOOL . . . Enabled.
         Can not continue !
        Please call the TYMCOM-X Support Line : (408) 446-6709

Diagnosis: SPLFIX had created SPOOL.GNW, SPOOL.FNW, and SPOOL.MNW.  The files
        SPOOL.MBK and SPOOL.FBK were dated 28-Feb-86 but SPOOL.GBK did not
        exist (maybe DSKCLN deleted it).  SPLFIX thought it needed to find
        this BAK file just so it could delete it.

Cure:   "COPY SPOOL.GDF,SPOOL.GBK", "RUN (UTIL)SPLFIX".  Done.

Note:   Carl and I both agree that this is not really a hotline problem.
        Maybe we need another policy for this kind of support on weekends.
        Anyway, SPLFIX needs to be changed so that it does not use the old phone
        number.

Woke up at 3:56 Monday morning with the bed shaking.  KGO says it was 5.6 on

No damage, some knick-knacks fell off the shelf, and the cuckoo clock started.
All the PDP-10s are up (except 74); I expected to find some down due to disks

I am in the TTE 235 class until Friday.  I cam across some interesting info.

SUB HOST ADDRESSING - Allows a user to connect to a particular line or set of
lines on a TYMCOM (async host interface).  Selection is based on two 
characters in the username.  For instance, "TRAINING78", "TRAINING75", and
"TRAININGKL" would allow connection to the 780 host, the 750 host, or the
KL host.

PORT ADDRESSING - Allows a host (or user) to connect to a particular line
on a CONSAT (async terminal interface).  Selection is based on digits after
a period in the host number.  For instance, "JMS:931.19" and "JMS:123.1".
Each addressable line can have many HOST.NUMBER combinations assigned to it.
Any host can seize an addressable port as long as no one else is using it.
These lines can also be used to log in from.

Addressing features must be enabled on a line by line basis in the TYM file.

maintains the Operating System and utilities for the Tymcom-X hosts.  

      The reason for their use of LOADII is to re-load the node code for the
micro-Tym-Bases in the "micro-network" (currently 5 nodes) which supports the
unit's lab hosts.  These hosts (930, 62 and 95) are used for development and
testing of the Operating System and utilites for Tymcom-X hosts.  The hosts
from which we will need to run LOADII are those on which the micro-Tym-base
code is developed and stored:  39 and 57.  The users are:

Subject: ISG GOVERNMENT CATALOG PRICING


ISG, through its Diversified Information Systems Company, 
currently has in effect certain GSA MASC government contracts 
which offer various products and services at Catalog Prices 
(standard prices on products and services sold in substantial 
quantities to the general public) with discounts equal to or 
better than the best prices charged to our commercial clients for 
such products and services.  Likewise, MDAIS, with the cooperation 
and approval of several ISG business units, has submitted to the 
government, catalog prices with associated best discounts for 
various products and services currently being offered to other MDC 
components for utilization in the performance of government 
contract requirements.

Violations of these warranties must be avoided in our commercial 
pricing practices.

If we provide better prices to a commerical client we then must 
notify the government and provide such lower price(s) to them.  
Failure to do so could have serious repercussions for ISG and MDC 
based on various common law and statutory remedies for fraud or 
misrepresentation, including criminal and civil penalities for 
false statements or claims.

If information is neded as to the specific product and service 
offerings and the associated best catalog price discounts, please 
contact Jim McDaniel of my staff at (314) 233-6103 or in Jim's 
absence, the writer at 232-6850.  Specific GSA information can 
also be obtained from Harry Webb, Diversified business unit 
contract specialist, Vienna, Virginia at (703) 556-7909.

Subject: XEXEC monitor requirements! 

We need some sort of %KSYS timer... maybe reasonable for TAKEIT to set
and reset this timer instead of doing whatever it does at the moment...
Then when KSYS goes off, TAKEIT kills everything (a la OPSER used to),
then the monitor itself runs a HANGUP job like INITIA/DSKCLN/KMCLOD at
the moment.  This way, the monitor doesn't have to do a while lot, and
we have a "clean" way of taking the system down... (and for BATCH to
know when to stop scheduleing jobs).

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of 
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG 
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of 
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also 
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This 
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production 
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center 
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME 
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG 
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible 
         for informing their clients of significant service 
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to 
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and 
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer" 
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls 
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls 
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be 
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls 
         regarding network or operational problems will be 
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and 
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM, 
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by 
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business 
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning 
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in 
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers 
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This 
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for 
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number 
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number 
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority 
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in 
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not 
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an 
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing 
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be 
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business 
    Units.

the position of Manager Contracts-ISG, reporting to me.

Dick's responsibilities in this new position will encompass both 
commercial and government contract policy statements, provide 
contract and negotiation assistance to the various business units 
on an as requested basis, and coordinate MDC corporate and ISG 
required contract related reports and special projects.

primarily responsible for performing government contracting 
activities relating to the above functions.  In addition, Jim is 
currently acting as the ISG focal point for the ISG Government 
Contract Survey.

Dick has twenty years of experience with MDC.  He started his 
career in MCAIR Procurement and for the past fifteen years with us 
has performed in various management positions in all areas of 
commerical and government contracts and pricing, both domestic and 
international.

Jim brings considerable expertise and experience in the government 
contracting sector and has been performing in various capacities 
in this regard since he joined MDC in May of 1979.

Please join me in wishing success to Dick and Jim in their new 
assignments.

As the final step in the division of responsibilities and personnel 
between the Diversified Controller's and ISG Group Controller's 
organizations, I am pleased to announce the appointment of Jerry L. 
Welsh as head of Commercial Contracts Administration for the 
Diversified Controller.

With MDC since 1972, Jerry originally was involved with governmental 
contracting for McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company and in 1976 
joined the McAuto Commercial Contracts group.  Subsequently he has 
held a series of positions of increasing responsibility within that 
organization and is well prepared to now assume a leadership role in 
the Diversified Controller's organization coordinating contractual 
activities in support of several Business Units - predominately 
Diversified Information Systems Company.

Jerry replaces Richard G. Hatz who, along with James G. McDaniel, 
will form the Contracts policy and coordination section of the ISG 
Group Controller's organization.

In addition to his existing contract development and negotiating 
team, Jerry will also have the Diversified contracts administrative 
groups in St. Louis and Vienna, Virginia reporting to him.

Please join me in wishing Jerry success in his new assignment.

Dallas Operations, Tyrone Hill, (214) 637-7435, System 27.

Problem: PFLLDC crashes, system stays up between 4 min and 2 hrs.
	 Also, DIEREH intersperced over the past 3 days.

Analysis: Nothing positive, system was crashing at PFLLDC in CORE1.
	  Both J and Job reported 0.  Stack showed EXCMPE probably
	  fell into USRFLT then xct PFLLDC at USRFLT+3.  I patched
	  the running monitor & system.sav to determine if the STOPCD
	  was caused by null-job or non-zero LDC.. Added PFLNUL in
	  patch area & system crashed at PFLNUL a while later...

Solution: Still unknown, Steve Atwell in Dallas maintenance tried
	  swapping various boards, the latest were E/UBR and address
	  decoders and after the PFLNUL crash the diagnostics finally
	showed a positive fault in the PI clock interrupt and they
	took over to run diagnostics about 18:00.  Will call me at
	home if it starts crashing again after fixing the problem.
	They feel it is definately HW but wanted help in pin-pointing
	the problem.  (they had replaced all of the pager boards and
	the problem still wouldn't go away).

Subject: Job Queue - License bits 

We need to maintain some level of control over what entities (persons and
programs) can manipulate the job queue data.  We have at our disposal one
free bit in the privilege word, 3 free bits in the "real" license word and
(I think) 9 or 10 free bits of "pseudo" license.

I propose that we use one of the 3 bits in the license word to allow users
and programs to perform certain "privileged" queue functions, such as insert
delete and setting system-level priorities.  I also think that OP license
may be enough to allow operations to run some programs, but that operators
in general should not have this Queue-Manipulation (QM) license.  Instead a
pseudo license Queue-Administrator (QA) ought to be given them which would
require a TATTLE record to be written with their OPERNAME whenever they need
to change something and programs having QM license would check QA license
before they allow users/processes to do things.

**** Defacto **** Temporarily, in lieu of discussion, I've defined LC.QM as
1B11 (1B29 for frame) for this purpose.  Nothing {SETOP,OPER,MONITOR,etc.}
knows about it (yet), but it's there in the programs being written today.

Comments?  Aspersions?  Complaints?

In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 21 Apr 86 15:25:30 PST

JL license might be reasonable since one having JL license could write their
own PERP to do whatever they want.  One reason to have a new license for the
PERP replacement would be to be able to give it to people you didn't want to
give JL to.  However, since much of the power infered by JL is manifest in an
indirect manner in the queue file, manipulating it is tantamount to JL.  I
also doubt that you'd want to give this new license to anyone who doesn't
already have JL, anyway.  I suppose that manipulating the queue does not give
one indirectly or otherwise the ability to create frames logged in to any
arbitrary PPN as JL does -- in that sense it is considerably less powerful.
If the new PERP validates Usernames/PPN's in the queue file against the LUD
as I have assumed in my last statement, then this would be an argument for
making the new license, and considering it less powerful than JL.

I completely and emphatically agree that the license to directly manipulate
the queue, QM or JL or whatever, be held only by development/systems people.
The kind of access required by operations should be allowed through a program
which holds QM/JL and performs the limited and audited functions on behalf of
an operator validated by OP or some such license.  Being set on the frame may
be enough since the audit trail to the operator name does exist in the stream.

Well, that's the sum total of my babble on the subject.  How's it going?
Need a beta test site?  We have no PERP at all so a flakey one would be
welcome!  I'd even be willing to insert stuff in the queue by hand if
necessary until things solidify.

The new base has been installed on systems 25, 36 and 54 on 4/19/86
after NTD's internal testing on 2 NTD systems. So far, we have not received
any problem report on LOADII Data Lost or Buffer Zapped with system 25
or 54. By this Friday (4/25/86), if everything looks positive - nobody
complains about the new base, we will carry out the installation plan
as shown above.

If you have any concern about the base installation, please call me ASAP at
(408)-942-5190 or send an Ontyme message to nss.f/chen.

Rick,
   As it appears, your memo on patching systems is a slightly updated
version of the previous policy.  I'd like to point out that username
XCONSULT is not utilized as an effective message sending name.  If it
is utilized at all...

    Please... if we are to use ONTYME, send all messages to TXS.SUP for
any kind of resonable response.  If you'd like to go over your memo with
me, there are a couple of other things...  The old systems of updating

Subject: C24 keeps crashing in a two-instruction loop, interrupts off. 

Symptom: RUN is on, PI ENABLED all off, PI IN PROGRESS on channel 3, PI
REQUEST on channel 7, pressing SINGLE INST and hitting CONT shows that the PC
is in a 1, 2, or 3 instruction loop, one of the instructions has zero in the
left half.  Can't do a 147 or a 146 restart - parts of COMMON have been wiped
out.

The loop for (SYS)CRA001 was around USRXIT+17.  The code there hsav been wiped
out by what looks like a stack.

This problem also occurred this afternoon in P19.  The operators were unable
to read-in BOTLOD until after core was cleared.  I have experienced this 
sort of hang with other monitors, but only on C24's hardware.  Could be
flakey pager or UUO trapping.  C24 wouldn't stay up long enough for me to
check (SYS)CRA002.

26-Apr-86 11:46 and 12:15/Carl
Contact:  CUPC Operations, Steve Carrothers, (408)446-7705, System C26

Symptom:  System crashes attempting all-files with TITO.  Last user done
	  was (BETATESTINT).  Assumption was that a file in BETATESTINT
	  was bad.  Checked with Osman since similar problem occurred on
	  13-Apr-86, system 26.

Problem:  File 041486.SAT in (BILLING10) was bad.  File could be looked
	  at, but not read completely.  CKSUM and copy failed & crashed
	  the system.

	  Examined file with TSTSUP.  File has a hole in it an otherwise
	  appears to be normal.  These files should not have holes in them!
	  Apparently something is deleting a page without updating all the
	  proper file-system tables and thus a hole in this file seems to
	  be causing a crash.

Solution: The file was marked bad by hand using TSTSUP and this prevents
	  TITO from attempting to put it on tape.  The file was renamed to
	  (CRASH:26) for further examination.

Subject: 2 questions. 

      1.)  Terminal lines to our micro-network:  Yasu has moved the 4 lines
from the cluster of cubicles which includes Bruce's terminal, mine, and the
terminal ( ADM-31 & slaved TI-820 RO) used for 930 & 62 backups.  They are now
in the vicinity of the patch-panel on the back of the rack with our host
cluster.  They are the four lines ending on the floor, to the left of the
other lines from the ceiling.  They are identified by the colored tape:
	yellow:  Bruce's terminal
	blue:  my terminal
	red:  'backup' terminal
	orange:  unused, currently ending in unused cubicle, but long enough
	    to reach any of the other cubicles, like Bruce's Diablo.
	
      Where do they plug in at the host site?  Also, Yasu needs to know where
Craig's line will plug in when he moves it off the Engine, so Craig will be
out of the Network for the least time possible.

      2.)  Have received a call from Mallenkrodt:  their host is suddenly
flakey, with an average up-time of 2 hours.  Sometimes it auto-boots, and
sometimes it must be manually booted.  I have some information about the last
2 crashes, but will need some help interpreting.

Thanks,

Subject: ONTYME Layoff 

Apparently, there was a meeting this morning and ONTYME's development
group of 10 lost 7 people.  Three managers were also cut.  Adele and Lois
and Stuart are still among the survivors.  Ken Dawson was one of the 7
developers given 2 weeks notice.  (The standard line of finding transfer
positions inside the company.)

To Craig:
   i do not know what our RFP situation is, but it would be a very valuable
asset to our support capability, especially our applications group to talk
to Ken Dawson about joining our group.  i think he is interested, but i believe
we don't have any positions.

  i think it would be a waste to see that talent disappear, and have to train
someone new, since Ken already has much of the training we are developing.

For the past few months, there has been a struggle in the Vienna, Virginia 
office by the Veterans Administration (VA) Project Implementation Team to  
have VA surpass Southwest Bell as the largest Private Network for Tymnet.  
On Saturday, April 19, the efforts of a very dedicated Project Implementation   
Team resulted in the VA becoming the largest Private Network. It has surpassed  
Southwest Bell, which was previously the largest with a node count of 239. 
As of today, the VA Private Network installed node count is 245. 
     
The Project Implementation Team is headed by Allen Jakobitz, Sr. Project   
Manager, and Ed Macnamara, Project Manager.  The other team members are    
David Auerbach, Regional Technical Consultant; Dan Steinman, Communications
Consultant; Mike Betty, Communications Consultant and Mike Perez, Project  
Administrator.  This Project Implementation Team was also assisted by a    
concerted effort of the Field Engineering Organization, which has done an  
excellent job in providing support for this most complex project.
     
The VA contract was awarded in January of 1984 and installation of all the 
VA nodes will conclude in September of 1986, when the network will install 
its 320th node.
     
Congratulations and thanks go to all the members of the Project Implementation  
Team and all of Tymnet for the outstanding job that has been performed.

Subject: LOGOUT loops forever if the UFD interlock is busy. 

LOGOUT gets the UFD interlock before cleaning up the directory (deleting TMP
files and such).  If the DSKB interlock is busy for 6 minutes, it jumps to
the label NXTSTR to do the next structure.  Unfortunately, NXTSTR has "DSKB"
hardcoded in, therefore it loops back trying DSKB again and again.

Dennis reported that there were 6 jobs logged in as WRPNET and all 6 were
in SL wait state, had been for some time, and had JACCT making them immune
to TAKEIT.  I located the call to LOKSTR in the listing and put a JFCL in
the error return in (SYS:28)LOGOUT.SHR.  5 minutes later one of the jobs
timed out, hit the JFCL, did its work, released the UFD interlock, and went
away.  Within a few seconds all the other jobs did likewise.

We should either patch LOGOUT on all systems or distribute a new release as
soon as possible.

In-reply-to: your message of Wed, 7 May 86 13:47:32 PDT

Joe,
  this is a known bug...

On some systems WRS has patched the interlock check to a JFCL... it happens
a lot on very heavily loaded systems that somehow the interlock gets stuck
and the all jobs get stuck trying to loginn or logout. 

I haven't "patched" it because i think the timeout wait is needed, but... it
ought to fall out of the timeout loop after so many tries.   if you want to
change the source to loop for a few tries, then fall out, fine by me...

This has been a known bug for quite a long time.. in fact I thought you knew
about it... only single bit correction on your memory?  try bi-polar...

(M33)PMON.PAT has been updated to include BIOZAP.PAT and DIETYO.PAT.

Differences between P034/P-8 and P034/P-10.

Patch #9, BIOZAP.PAT - Do not crash the base when a zap is received on a port
that is doing block-I/O and the PDP-10 hasn't had a chance to do any clean-up
yet.  This occurs sometimes when a circuit is zapped while running TELECOPY.

Patch #8, DIETYO.PAT - Fix INFO stopcodes so that TTYZNE, WRTSAT, and BADSAT
do not crash the system.  Instead, they output an appropriate message to the
CTY and the system continues.  Fix all other types of stopcodes to update the
key so that the base won't get unhappy and deposit nonzero in 30 until after
the crash dump is started.

P034/P-10 has been installed on the following systems:
9-May-86 in NEWMON on all Dallas machines at the request of Tom Marconi.
D23, D25, D27, D31, D37, D54, D56, D65, D72, D79.

Wednesday, May 14th, 7:00pm - At DEC's offices at 2525 Augusting Drive in 
Santa Clara.  Agenda: Select a new steering committee, develop a list of future
topics.  The usual question and answer session will follow, representatives
from DEC are expected to be there.

Thursday, May 15th, 6:30pm - At DEC's offices at 101 California Street, 31st
Floor in San Francisco (1/2 block from BART's Embarcadero Station).
Topics: Programming Languages (comparison of the languages available for the
Rainbow-100, DECmate II, and PRO-350).  Public Domain software will be
available for a slight fee to core the duplication costs.

I am planning to go to both, does anyone else plan to BART up to SF?

Subject: Bug in F3 microcode. 

I was checking the instructions that DEC defined after the KI was built to see
if the F3 executed these new opcodes the same as the KL and KS.  I haven't gone
thru the entire list, because I was rudely halted in the double-integer codes.

DADD = opcode 114 = add pair of ACs to pair of memory locations and store the
		    71-bit integer result in the two ACs. 
This works on the F3.

DSUB = opcode 115 = subtract pair of memory locations from pair of ACs and
		    store the 71-bit integer result in the two ACs.
This works on F3.

DMUL = opcode 116 = multiply pair of memory locations by pair of ACs and store
		    the quad-word result in four ACs.
Unimplemented on F3 - traps to INSSIM which goes to ILLINS.

DDIV = opcode 117 = divide quad-word number in four ACs by pair of memory
		    locations.  Put quotient in two ACs, reminder in two ACs.
This halts the F3 microcode.

The F3 is halted very dead by opcode 117.  The MI STOP light was on, as were
MI PAR ERROR and MEM PAR ERROR.  (I have hardcopy showing which lights were on
and what instruction I used.)

Since I was not sure that the microcode could be successfully restarted, so
I reloaded the microcode and reloaded 930.  I am sure the same would happen
on 62, where an unprivileged user running DDT can halt the system.

I came in Saturday and found the second F3 halted.  MEM PAR ERROR was on,
MI STOP was on, but MI PAR ERROR was off (this is different from the DDIV
halt).  I could not even start to reload the microcode in 62 because its
tape drive has vacuum problems - it won't load the tape.  62 is sitting in
the same state I found it, the lights still show the microcode status at the
time of the halt

No problem.  We remove the two-pack TYMCOM-X disks, put DSKA in 0 and DSKB in
1, then boot.  (DSKC does not have to be mounted.)  The default monitor in
SYS:SYSTEM.EXE is KS-702.  I could build a 701A monitor for the 2020 without
too much problem.			/JMS

Craig,
  To use TOPS-10, just BOOT system 95 from the DSKA and DSKB packs (DSKA
has to be in the drive with the 0 plug).  To log in, type "I" on the TYM444,
INITIA will log in a [1,2] job there.

Subject: REFSTR 

I believe it is finished.  The problem was that after running off the end
of the unit list, I didn't reset U to point at anything (let alone the first
unit) and PCBIO got upset.  I put in code to reset it, and it worked fine.
I built a 4-pack system, then disolved it, then built a 2 pack system.  I am
restoring the all-files tape to it to prove to myself that it will do all
that it's supposed to... then I will do an ADD-PACK to verify that that will
also work correctly.  I don't expect any problems.

Subject: 24 re:: REFSTR ? 

The 2-pack system died in the middle of the all-files rebuild.  I'm not
syre why, it got an IME stopcd and I lost the crash by trying to dump it
to the "good" packs instead of the "2-pack" packs.

Anyway, It seems one of the UFD's is bad but that's all I know at the
moment. I just crashed it... will tell all more tomorrow.  /Carl

Subject: Hours... 

I will probably NOT be in early today....  I've finished a REFSTR that
works as best as the packs will let it.  (It created SPAGES.SYS just fine,
but I think DSKCLN didn't like 2 pages in the file and marked them as
holes in the rib, [I donno what it did to the pages in the SATs]).  I built
a 3-pack system, dumped a bunchof files to it from 930, and thinned the
files down a little.

There's a "working" skeleton system on 24 now... not everything works...
for example, TELECOPY works pulling, but not pushing?  May be a base bug,
but don't depend on it!  SPOOL is not expected to work, etc...

I didn't write a boots, and am not worried about it at present.... we need
to do that Osman,...  

Most of the MONITOR utility programs and such are out there...

  (SYS) has some compilers, etc, PEAK, VUE, TECO, ...RPG, PIP, DIRIT, etc.
 (FTSYS) has TECO 124a, and a few updated things, eg MACRO %53B
  (OSU) has some tools, some things that were in (WRS)
  (MPL) has more tools
 (CARL) and (JMS) have various copies of other things & DEC programs.
 (PJ) has a jOBS.DAT FILE but there is no (TYMNET) files.

Good night....

OSMAN will make an all-files of this system then overwrite it by making
the biggest 3650 system he can without wiping out our 2 1-pack systems.

Subject: (TYMNET)NODES.MAP updated for 14-bit node numbers. 

NODES.MAP is now 96 pages long - it has a 3-word entry for all 16834 possible
14-bit node numbers.  All nodes that do not have an explicit name now have
a 9-character implicit name.  The implicit name consists of a space, a hyphen,
the 5-digit node number (from 00000 to 37777), another hyphen, and another
space.  The program (TYMNET)DEFNOD does not list implicit names so that
it is easier to see the defined node names.

Now that the fully expanded NODES.MAP has been telecopied to all systems,
SYSTAT won't get into a loop anymore.  SYSTAT currently does not even attempt
to look for the name of any mode above 7777, which is OK since the base passes
only 12 bits to SCNSER (for LDBLOG).

Try running SYSTAT (with license set) on a "real" system to see the new names.

My manger (Craig Fletcher) wants to connect a VAX-780 to the network, if
the costs are within reason.  He has asked me to communicate with you about
this.  We first need to know the costs:
   1.)  the installation charge, &
   2.)  the monthly charge.

The situation is as follows:
The host would be located at our facility on Albrae St. in Fremont.
The connection to the netowrk would PROBABLY be async Tymcom.
We currently have node 06630 at the site.  This is an ISIS node, with a
tymsat slot, supporting 64 ports.  We are told by FSC that the engine has
2 extra async boards.

Please respond with your answers to Craig, as soon as possible.  If you are
not the person to handle this please pass it on to the proper person and
notify Craig who the contact person is.  Craig can be reached at:

Ok, no meeting tomorrow...

  I believe the test worked.  Osman built a 12-pack system with 24XP19
and successfully ran with the KL.  One glitch was that the KL monitor did
not have Joe's "ignore-blocks-packs" code and it at first tried to come
up using the 1-pack blocks pack until that was powered down.  REFSTR
appears to work as expected.  One drive powered itself off and would not
spin up and that was where we were last night.  Osman will have to fill
in the rest of the info.

Subject: 3650 Project & This weekend.. 

1. Well, today(3/6) I finally go to "Jury Duty"

2. 3650 Project for C26 is "GO" for this weekend.
   I build a 12-pack system over the weekend but,
   2 hrs after finished rebuilding the system lost
   one of the disk therefore lost the 12-pack system.

3. I am on the process of building an other 10-pack
   system, to check out disk, monitor and all the other
   utilities, pakcop, asp, tito etc..

4. I have not acounter any problems so far with disk,
   like disk errors or any utilities not doing what 
   they suppose too.

5. I will continue to rebuild and checking. I will
   do asp dump after restoring the all-files.

6  For this weekend I will assist ops for the move
   and be available for help.

I think it is because F38 has two 3672 control units and four 3673 string
controllers.  This means that 4 disks can be seeking to a new cylinder at
the same time, and 2 disks can be searching for ID= at the same time.
C24 has only 1 control unit and 2 string controllers.

Well, C26 is up and running with the "3650 DISKS"

So far, I have not discovered anything unusual except:
1) DSKCLN taking longer, 1 hr and 14 mins on KL.
2) After ASP dump, picked up 2 or 3 HDEV errors on
   most of the disks. Disks were running error  free
   during ALL-FILES restore.
3) SA10NW diagnostic tape which works when loaded on KI
   doesn't work on KL. Something we need to look into
   soon so that MAINT people have tools to work with.
   I have an idea what the problem might be, will look

We need to do everything we can to ensure the ISG meets its 1986 
revenue and earnings objectives.  In line with this need I am 
announcing, effective today, the following organizational changes:

o   The North American Marketing and Sales organization that 
    formerly reported within McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
    Systems Company is now part of McDonnell Douglas Computer 
    Systems Company.  This restructuring will better equip the 
    Computer Systems Company to compete in the business systems 
    marketplace while it continues to meet ISG's internal hardware 
    manufacturing needs.  The restructured company will be headed 
    up by Otis Brinkley as President, with Vern Smith as Executive 
    Vice President.  In the coming weeks, Otis and Vern will work 
    together to develop an optimal structure for the Computer 
    Systems Company.

o   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company has been 
    dissolved in an effort to narrow the range of our business 
    activities and focus more on profitability.  The business 
    units within the Distribution Systems Company have been 
    reassigned as follows:

    -     Our Commercial Distribution Systems and Electronic Data 
          Interchange businesses are now part of McDonnell Douglas 
          Diversified Information Systems Company.  As such, these 
          businesses will continue to pursue their 1986 Operating 
          Plan objectives.

    -     Our embryonic Retail Systems business is being assigned 
          to ISG Marketing and Planning, where it will continue to 
          develop its strategy, though at a much lower level of 
          investment than we had planned for the balance of 1986.





1'm confident that these actions will increase our chances of 
achieving our 1986 objectives.  I'm counting on you not only to 
support these moves, but to do whatever you can to ease the 
transition for the people affected by them.

Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  elected medical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

the west side of VG1 and VG2 adjacent to the lobby entrance.
All employees entering VG1 and VG2 can do so through the
front lobby entrance.  This entrance will be open 24 hours
a day during this weekend as well as the lobby to VG3.
All employees should have their vehicles moved to the
appropriate spaces no later than 5:00 AM on 8 March 1986.

Contrary to rumors you may be hearing, no final decision has been 
made to discontinue company matching contributions to the ISG 
Employee Savings Plan.  Our current need to cut costs, however, is 
causing us to look for ways to more closely link matching 
contributions to ISG's profitability.

I believe we can make the plan's cost more appropriate to ISG's 
current financial condition and at the same time keep it an 
attractive investment option for you.  In the coming weeks we'll be 
giving a representative sampling of employees a chance to comment 
on the various alternatives under consideration.  I'm committed not 
to make changes until we have thoughtfully looked at the plausible 
options and can select a course that serves both your needs and the 
needs of ISG.

I'll keep you posted on our progress.

Subject: 26: BPA1/BPA10 == DSKB5 

Joe,
  The reason that this happens is that the BPA1 is a left subset of
BPA10 and since there is no BPA1 at the moment (powered off) it picks
the first unit that matches... i.e. BPA10 and returns DSKB5.  As for
DSKB1 (BPA15) and DSKB11 (BPA2) both returning BPA2, again this is
doing the same thing... it's searching the physical tables for a left
subset and stops when it finds a match.  *** THIS IS A BUG ***  It
ought to check for exact matches first, then if it cannot find one
return the left subset.

  I manually checked each unit, and got the correct results in BPA
order.  SY checks using logical device names.  If Osman had not reversed
the order of the logical units and the physical units, this would never
have shown up!  Osman did a good thing!!!  It means we need to fix it
at some point.

Carl:

      It was a hardware problem.  DEC had spent the whole weekend working on
the RH-11, and cleaimed that they had fixed any problems, "so it must be
software".  Last night I talked to Bud Reinhardt, Mallenkrodt's chief
operator.  Bud told me the problem was also occurring with MAGCON!

      I told Frank Huels (Mallenkrodt's data center mgr.)  that it had to be
hardware, as you and I had discussed.  He called DEC back in this a.m.  Their
F.E.  found that one of the three new replacement boards in the RH-11 was
cracked!  He swapped it out, and they have successfully completed an all-files
backup.  We now have Huel's confidence.

After the last time X62 came up, it was beeping waiting for the time.  The
ADM3 connected to node 10115 got no response.  So I logged into system 39,
created (MPL)RELOAD.115, and ran it.

How are we going to reload the PDP-11 microTYMbases once C39 is on BUBBNET?
Is it simply a matter of putting a Gateway command and password in RELOAD.* ?
What password will LOADII need to build a circuit to 3163 for reloading?

Subject: Reloading from 39? 

Unknown as to how that will work.... I've obsconded with a copy of SMITII
and it is in (SMITHDE) which seems to be the only place that it will run
from without logging you out.  So, if 930 & 6657 is up, we can load from
there, and after copying it to 62, we should be able to go the other way
with some ease.  TELECO works fine through the gateway, and LOADII will
go through a gateway, but I do not know the procedure.

System 57 is a backup of some fo the code on 39, but (CURR11) and (NEW11)
are not backed up anywhere as far as I know.  maybe we should also find
the reason whay we cannot load 6657 from 930... I believe it has somethng
to do with CIOPR... sigh.  History bites us again!

SUBJ:  Field Service Company's Network Access: This Building. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      I've received a phone call from Tymnet:  FSC's access to Tymnet in this
building, both for terminals and for our hosts, is not 'legal'.  I.e., Payment
Systems Co.  pays for the engines in this building and for the synchronous
network line to connect to the public network.  Pmnt. Sys. Co.  is billed by
Tymnet for this service.  We do not pay for it at all.  I am told, by Tymnet,
that our traffic "degrades Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s service", and that our use of
service purchased by another company is not allowed.

      I have discussed this with Pat Diamond, and he has agreed to handle the
solution of this problem.  He and I discussed some alternatives, and the
suggestion which he said he will persue most strongly includes:  the
installation on site here (as a 'lab' machine--self installed) of a Tymnet
Engine that FSC owns; and upgrading the line(s) (from here to Solar Way) which
Pmnt. Sys. Co.  'owns', from 9.6 Kbps to 14.4 Kbps.

      Our lab machine would be the pass-through connection for our micro-
Tym-Bases and would provide any terminal connections we might need to take off
Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engines.  The only traffic that Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engine
will have may be pass-through traffic.  We could share costs for the lines
with Pmnt. Sys. Co., connecting one line to their machine and the other to
our machine.  Pat tells me that this would probably provide service MUCH more
quickly than ordering new phone service from Pac. Tel., and--if Sal Spinelli
of Pmnt. Sys. Co. agrees--be less expensive.

      Pat tells me that he will contact Sal next week:  Sal is in Irvine this
week, but next week will be available at Tymnet, Orchard Parkway.  He will be
in meetings there next week about their network access problems, but be able
to be reached by the Tymnet operator.

Subject: Network access change: Liberty. 

      Discussion of this pending change with Joe Smith has shown this to be an
opportunity:  if we get the lab node, we could have an ISIS machine which
would allow an Async Host Interface TYMCOM slot, as well as a Async Terminal
Interface CONSAT slot.  The Host Interface slot could allow us to bring the
the 2020 (host 95) into the network quickly, plus we could put the consoles
for the hosts on them -- allowing us to use the consoles remotely (through
network sub-addressing).

      Another alternative could be connecting to the Albrae St.  location.
This could provide redundancy, if this were in addition to the lines discussed
previously.  If we order any lines, I believe ordering directly from Pac.
Tel. will will be significantly less expensive than ordering from Tymnet.
Tymnet's monthly charge for service between here and Solar Way:  Tymnet's
monthly charge would be over $700 -- the advantage they offer is Tymnet
Network Control's reporting of and follow up on the line outage.

      Pat suggested another cost-saving alternative for redundancy from our
engine to the network:  a dial-up Network sync line, rather than a 4-wire
dedicated line.

         DEFERRAL OF ISG MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT

CC:      Business Unit Coordinators



One  of  the  principles  given  to us this year is to manage ISG's
operating  results month by month.  In so doing, we have determined
a  need  to  minimize  ISG costs in the first half of the year.  To
respond  to that need we have moved the Management and Professional
Development  Phases  I-VII  provided  to  MDAIS  into the first two
quarters of 1986.

To  accomplish  this adjustment, MDAIS Phases have been substituted
for  ISG  Phases.    Subsequently, those ISG Phases scheduled after
March 17 will be deferred into the last half of the year.
 
In  addition  to  having  a  significant  favorable impact on ISG's
operating  results  for the first half of this year, the completion
dates  for  Phases  III  and V are moved forward.  As a result, the
full  line of Phases will be in production for the ISG beginning in
June.

The  revised  schedule  and allocations will be available from your
business  unit  coordinator  on  April 8.  It is important that you
continue   to   plan   for   your,   and/or   your   subordinates',
participation  in  the  proper  Phase.  Advance planning allows for
timely  notification  of  participants and for time to complete the
required prework for Phase attendance.

         DEFERRAL OF ISG MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT

CC:      Business Unit Coordinators



One  of  the  principles  given  to us this year is to manage ISG's
operating  results month by month.  In so doing, we have determined
a  need  to  minimize  ISG costs in the first half of the year.  To
respond  to that need we have moved the Management and Professional
Development  Phases  I-VII  provided  to  MDAIS  into the first two
quarters of 1986.

To  accomplish  this adjustment, MDAIS Phases have been substituted
for  ISG  Phases.    Subsequently, those ISG Phases scheduled after
March 17 will be deferred into the last half of the year.
 
In  addition  to  having  a  significant  favorable impact on ISG's
operating  results  for the first half of this year, the completion
dates  for  Phases  III  and V are moved forward.  As a result, the
full  line of Phases will be in production for the ISG beginning in
June.

The  revised  schedule  and allocations will be available from your
business  unit  coordinator  on  April 8.  It is important that you
continue   to   plan   for   your,   and/or   your   subordinates',
participation  in  the  proper  Phase.  Advance planning allows for
timely  notification  of  participants and for time to complete the
required prework for Phase attendance.

The Computer Systems Company has decided to curtail operations of 
the Distributed Systems Company.   This decision has been made as 
a result of declining prices for DSC products in the marketplace.  
Distributed  Systems  has  been operating at a loss  for  several 
months, with no relief in sight. 
 
Effective  immediately,  DSC  will no longer  accept  orders  for 
products.   For further information until April 11, 1986, contact

Subject: Using the GATEWAY command in TELECOPY. 

To TELECOPY files to or from system 39, you have to start on a PDP-10 on the
public net, build a gateway to BUBBNET, then copy the files.  The host numbers
of the gateways are: 5946, 1461, 1579, 5516, 5981, 1552, 2866, 3171, and 7255.
For example:

	.R TELECOPY
	: GATEWAY 7255;JMS:39
	Password <password for JMS on BUBBNET>
	: (*6NEWS:39)TELECO.DOC,(JMS:930)		;Pull a file from 39
	: (JMS:930)SWITCH.INI,:39			;Push a file to 39
	: QUIT

The gateway host numbers are listed in (*6NEWS)BUBNET.DOC on most PDP-10 systems.

Subject: 3650 disk project. 

Remaining items in the 3650 project:                    17-Mar-86

1) Verify that APT10 works.  It is designed to transfer files between the
   TYMCOM-X system and KLDCP DECtapes via the CTY.  Use it to put SA10NW on
   a DECtape.   This requires a standalone KL, brought up in CONSOLE mode.

2) Determine why the paper-tape version of BOTLOD does not work like the version
   in MONBTS.  This requires a standalone KI with 3650 disks for complete veri-
   fication, although most of the work could be done on C24 with Ampex disks.

3) After the KI version of BOTLOD works, put the KL version on the DECtapes
   using APT10.  This can be done during a scheduled downtime.

4) Determine where PAKCP5 fails when writing the secondary HOM and BAT pages.
   This is the only thing keeping the COPY command from working.  This requires
   standalone time on the CPU with 3650 disks, not more than one weekend.

5) Make a single version of PAKCOPY that understands 3675 in blocks and pages.
   This means that the size of the areas used for channel command lists need to
   be determined at run time, not as an assembly option.  This can be done on
   C24 with Ampex disks.

6) Locate the routines in the monitor that assume that all units of a structure
   are the same size.  Determine whether it is feasible to have a DSKB composed
   of a mixture of packs formatted in blocks and in pages.

7) Modify BOOTS to understand all 4 disk types.  Right now, "BOOTS" understands
   3675 blocks only, and "BOOTX" understands 3650 pages only.  This requires
   standalone time on C24 with Ampex disks, and can be verified on C26
   during a scheduled reload of the system.

8) Add a command to BOOTS telling it which set of packs to look at.  This is so
   that a one-pack test system can be kept spinning and not confuse the Monitor
   by having two packs claiming to be "DSKB0".  This will have a side effect of
   making BOOTS much faster in loading the monitor, and can be done on 930.

9) Install 2nd upgraded SA10 for continued testing on C24.

10) Add code to PAKCP5 that can rewrite HA/R0 on 3650.  I have disassembled the
   relevant portions of SA10NW.SAV, and will put them in PAKCOP.MAC.  Testing
   requires days of standalone time on C24 with new SA10 and 3650 disks.

11) Merge PAKCP5 with the pages version of 3675 PAKCOP.

12) Determine whether bad blocks really work.  Verify that PAKCOPY assigns
    alternate tracks correctly.  Make it look at the BAT block that SA10NW
    creates.  Make the monitor add new entries when it discovers bad pages.

Subject: Re: PAKCOP 3675 blocks/pages 

It might be a nice idea to "read-only" blocks and "write-only" pages with
a version of PAKCOP... Yes, I realize we will have extra pages after just
such a transfer, and that SAT.SYS would need to be fixed up, but it might
well be worth doing the formatting to pages and using only the same size
in blocks until the next REFRESH. That way, we save having to do a reformat
and a full-rebuild at the same time.

Bill,
  This was updated to handle node numbers > 7777 for SYSTAT and it's
obvious that some programs out there need to be fixed... i.e. SCREAM
and ACSCAN... but the problem probabluy is not in the fact that the
arrays for node numbers is smaller than NODES.MAP, but that there are
people logging in from nodes larger than 7777!

Have I told you about the large computer now installed and running at
Stacken, the computer club at the KTH (the Royal Institute of
Technology) in Stockholm? No? Well, then...

A few years ago, DEC (Digital Equipment Corp) in Sweden had a sort of
"white elephant" on their hands, a DECsystem-10 (the same type you are
running COM on), but a very old model with a KA10 CPU, single
transistor logic boards and good old core memory. Big as hell, lots of
blinkenlights, and with an appetite for kiloAmpere that would ruin any
computer hobbyist. The customer that had leased the thing did not want
it any more, and DEC did not even try to find another. But instead of
scrapping it, they gave it to us in Stacken. Sure, we could take care
of it, and even payed the transport (about 3000 SEK). But where would
we house such a beast? Fortunately, KTH promised us a place to run it.
For two years it was kept in a garage at KTH while we lobbyed the KTH
administration to give us that place. (There is a constant shortage of
space at KTH, alas). It was not after a new guy in Stacken, Peter
Lothberg, had renewed the efforts by pestering the Principal himself
for a while that we finally got the promised room to install it in.

Then around last spring (1985) the work started. During the summer of
1985 the place was refitted with a real raised computer room floor,
electrical power, terminal lines, a cooling machine with outdoor
condensors, and everything else needed to make the place a
full-fledged computer center.

Meanwhile, our DEC-10, now named "KATIA" (a pun on "Nadja" which is
the DEC-2020 at KTH and "KA-TIA", where "tia" is 10:er in swedish),
was temporary installed and tested at CCCC (Colossal Cave Computer
Center), Peter:s playroom where he already has a DECsystem-10 going.
That DEC-10, (named KICKI) was used for testing and debuggning Katia.
Without it, it might still be nonfunctional.

When the room was finished, Katia was moved in and re-debugged. (You
don't move such a beast without dislocating at least a few wires). And
then, one night last autumn, the champagne bottle, which had been
bought for just this reason, was opened. Katia was installed, and up
and running! According to the tradition, which begun with the
installing of Kicki a year eariler, the bottle is uncorked when you
can give the command MAKE LOVE on the console, which makes a file
named "LOVE" with the venerable TECO editor, and get the resonse "NOT
WAR?" on the console. (This is a "hack" in TECO, installed for obvious
reasons long ago, probably way back in the sixties).

Then on the 23rd of October 1985 Katia was officially inaugurated as
Stacken was throwing its first Big Party in its 7-year history, where
participants could awe at the extremely rare sight of over 100
computer hobbyists, nerds and hackers in (get this!) ties and jackets
(some of them even pinstriped!) The members and a large number of
specially invited dignitaries met at a splendid Dinner With Everything
at the KTH student corps house. Speeches were held, glasses were
raised, jokes were cracked and the atmosphere was high. After the
coffee everyone walked over to the room where Katia stood happily
humming since a few days, where the Principal inaugurated Katia by
cutting a punched tape spanned across the door.

Such a project can't be done without two things: many highly skilled
enthusiasts and a lot of money. Fortunately, Stacken had both. The
latter came from selling copies of our EMACS workalike editor "AMIS"
for about 500 USD a copy to other installations of DEC-10s, VAXen,
PR1MEs and Norsk Data. AMIS was our first success back in 1980, when
me and six others got fed up with not having a really good editor.
(I'm using it right now for writing this text). So AMIS, aside from
preventing us from going berserk, gave us the means to install Katia.

By the way, we can use more hardware. All sorts of donations are
appreciated. Especially disks, but we'll take anything that could
possibly be connected to a DECsystem-10. Also terminals, cooling
machines... anything. Send inquiries to me, or better still, to:
Datorforeningen Stacken, c/o NADA, KTH, S-10044 Stockholm, SWEDEN.

Katia is a neat hobby computer. Those kids and their daddys with
CBM-64:s can go suck on a BASIC manual. The DEC-10 is a REAL COMPUTER,
36 bit words, real tape, disks, DECtapes and a glorious collection of
blinking lights. It runs the TOPS-10 timesharing operating system, one
of the finest and most user-friendly OS ever made (it beats both VMS
and UNIX singlehandedly), rivalled only by TOPS-20. And the awesome
sight of Katia:s 12 large blue cabinets with the blinking lights, its
designed front panel and the rest of the hardware filling the room
stirs the heart. Katia looks like a computer should! This machine and
its worshippers are not unlike the phenomenon of people lovingly
restoring old steam engines and cars. But while Katia definitely is a
veteran computer, it's still modern. It outperforms a medium-sized VAX
and has a much neater instruction set. (Long live the DECsystem-10
designers!) And there are gigabytes upon gigabytes with highly
sophisticated software which we can run on it. Our only problem so far
is what to do with all those unused CPU cycles.

Anyone wants a million prime numbers?


(Text 16633)------------------------------


[Actually the MAKE LOVE trap is in COMPIL and in the old days when tops20
 exec still had the compil interface in it, you could get the not war
 response on tops20 as well. Although this code has been conditionalled out
for some time it was only with tops20 version 5 that it went alltogether.
A sad day !! To the maintainers of PCL : If goto hell on the dec10 responds
with get stuffed can't we have something like that or better under tops20 ?

Fremont Peak State Park.  We arrived at 4:07am; the moon was still up.  But you
could see Halley's with the naked eye.  At 4:30 the moon went down and the view
got better.  The tail of the comet took up half the field of view in 7x35
binoculars ("It looks like all the pictures of comets!").  It started to fade
at 5:00am when the sky got light.  ("We saw Halley's comet!")

Through a telescope, the field of view is too small to see the entire tail all
at the same time.  One guy had an 8-inch by 7 foot reflector - it showed the
nucleus as a distinct disk in the middle of a fuzzy spot.  And Saturn's rings
are quit spectacular even in the smaller telescopes.

The moon sets 1/29th of a day later each time, so it will still be in the sky
at 4:45 Sunday morning; that's the last time Halley's will be visible for
about 2 weeks.

         INTERCOMPANY PRICING BOARD CHANGES



    Effective  immediately,  the  charter  and  composition  of the
    Intercompany Pricing Board are changed as follows.

    The charter of the Intercompany Pricing Board is to:

    o    Establish  operational  ground  rules  and  procedures  as
         necessary to ensure effective implementation of policy.

    o    Review   and  approve  proposed  changes  to  intercompany
         Pricings.

    o    Review  operation of intercompany pricing policy, Pricings
         and  supporting  systems  and  make recommendations to ISG
         Executive  Management  as  necessary  to  ensure effective
         operation of intercompany pricing policy.

    o    Resolve    issues   relating   to   intercompany   pricing
         including,  when  appropriate,  making  recommendations to
         and obtaining approval of Executive Management.

    o    Interpret  intercompany  pricing policy as required in the
         operational environment.

    o    Determine specific handling of exceptional situations.

    o    Ensure  that decisions reached by the Intercompany Pricing
         Board  are implemented in the organizations represented by
         members of the Board.

    With  the  undersigned  as  Chairman,  the Intercompany Pricing
    Board will include the following representatives:

         Craig, S. L.:                  Payment Systems Co.
        *Donovan, J. R.:                ISG  Marketing and Planning
                                        (ex officio)

         Freeman, F. R.:                Information      Processing
                                        Center
         Frey, D. J.:                   Manufacturing             &
                                        Engineering Systems Co.
         Horn, E. T.:                   Government Services
         Johnson, R. W.:                Computer Systems Co.
         Kintsch, H. J.:                Field Service Co.
         Kos, J. J.:                    Health Systems Co.
        *Krone, L. H.:                  ISG     Marketing    Policy
                                        (Alternate Chairman)






             *LeCroy, E. P.:     ISG Finance
             *Mundloch, R. A.:   ISG Finance
              Schenk, R. W.:     Diversified Information Systems Co.
              Schneider, D. A:   Communications Industry Systems Co.
              Vickroy, W. R.:    Information Systems International
             *Wiedenmann, P. W.: ISG Finance (ex officio)

    Those  Pricing  Board  members  indicated  by * are also members of the
    Intercompany   Pricing  Board  Executive  Council.    This  Council  is
    established  to  provide  timely  and  efficient  resolution of pricing
    questions  at  such  times  when  business conditions do not permit the
    assembly  of  the  full  Intercompany  Pricing Board.  The Council will
    meet only as occasionally required.

    Don  W.  Gerth has successfully completed his assignment to develop the
    policy  and  supervise the implementation of ISG's intercompany pricing
    mechanism.      Without   his  energy  and  attention  to  detail,  the
    intercompany  pricing  program would not be as complete as it is today.
    Effective  14  February  1986,  Don leaves ISG Marketing and returns to
    the  McDonnell  Douglas Manufacturing Industry Systems Company.  Please
    join  me  in  expressing appreciation to Don for his outstanding effort
    over the past year.

    With   D.  W.  Gerth's  departure,  responsibility  for  the  continued
    operation  of  Intercompany  Pricing  is  transferred  to ISG Marketing
    Policy,  the  focal point for Intercompany Pricing administration.  All
    future  intercompany pricing matters should be addressed to L. H. Krone
    (I014/301/4E; Phone:  314-233-0002, ONTYME:  ISGHQ.L/KRONE).
    Your continued cooperation will be appreciated.

Subject: LOGON and SWITCH.INI 

It is "nice" that LOGON will let you select options based on node-port
or simply node.  TYMNET nodes on the otherhand do NOT, (I repeat, do NOT)_,
report the physical port number anymore.  Not just the micro-nodes... all
TYMNET nodes are that way...  so, physical port number is meaningless in
99.9 percent of the cases.  (On a micronode,connected to a host, it has a
little meaning, by co-incidence).  The port reported is more likely the
circuit number reported to ISIS (or it's look-alikes).

So,  please don't feel that you are having problems with LOGON if you
cannot get it to select on a specific port.  TYMNET isn't really reporting
the physical port to the host anymore.  The Node information IS correct if
you are coming from a real node, and sometimes is a lie for internal circuits
on a micro-node host.  All "real" circuits, are supposed to be correct.

Sigh!

30-Mar-85 10:18/JMS
Contact:  Fremont Ops, Elisha Padilla, (415)498-2588, System 28.

Symptom:  SPOOL not running, SPLFIX gets a fatal error on file SPOOL.GBK
        Renaming files, wait...
        LOOKUP failed for (SPOOL)SPOOL.GBK.
        Fatal error.
        Enabling SPOOL . . . Enabled.
         Can not continue !
        Please call the TYMCOM-X Support Line : (408) 446-6709

Diagnosis: SPLFIX had created SPOOL.GNW, SPOOL.FNW, and SPOOL.MNW.  The files
        SPOOL.MBK and SPOOL.FBK were dated 28-Feb-86 but SPOOL.GBK did not
        exist (maybe DSKCLN deleted it).  SPLFIX thought it needed to find
        this BAK file just so it could delete it.

Cure:   "COPY SPOOL.GDF,SPOOL.GBK", "RUN (UTIL)SPLFIX".  Done.

Note:   Carl and I both agree that this is not really a hotline problem.
        Maybe we need another policy for this kind of support on weekends.
        Anyway, SPLFIX needs to be changed so that it does not use the old phone
        number.

No damage, some knick-knacks fell off the shelf, and the cuckoo clock started.
All the PDP-10s are up (except 74); I expected to find some down due to disks
powering down.

I am in the TTE 235 class until Friday.  I cam across some interesting info.

SUB HOST ADDRESSING - Allows a user to connect to a particular line or set of
lines on a TYMCOM (async host interface).  Selection is based on two 
characters in the username.  For instance, "TRAINING78", "TRAINING75", and
"TRAININGKL" would allow connection to the 780 host, the 750 host, or the
KL host.

PORT ADDRESSING - Allows a host (or user) to connect to a particular line
on a CONSAT (async terminal interface).  Selection is based on digits after
a period in the host number.  For instance, "JMS:931.19" and "JMS:123.1".
Each addressable line can have many HOST.NUMBER combinations assigned to it.
Any host can seize an addressable port as long as no one else is using it.
These lines can also be used to log in from.

Addressing features must be enabled on a line by line basis in the TYM file.

      The following users need to be validated for use of LOADII.  All users
are members of the Tymcom-X Systems unit -- the organization which writes and
maintains the Operating System and utilities for the Tymcom-X hosts.  

      The reason for their use of LOADII is to re-load the node code for the
micro-Tym-Bases in the "micro-network" (currently 5 nodes) which supports the
unit's lab hosts.  These hosts (930, 62 and 95) are used for development and
testing of the Operating System and utilites for Tymcom-X hosts.  The hosts
from which we will need to run LOADII are those on which the micro-Tym-base
code is developed and stored:  39 and 57.  The users are:

Subject: ISG GOVERNMENT CATALOG PRICING


ISG, through its Diversified Information Systems Company, 
currently has in effect certain GSA MASC government contracts 
which offer various products and services at Catalog Prices 
(standard prices on products and services sold in substantial 
quantities to the general public) with discounts equal to or 
better than the best prices charged to our commercial clients for 
such products and services.  Likewise, MDAIS, with the cooperation 
and approval of several ISG business units, has submitted to the 
government, catalog prices with associated best discounts for 
various products and services currently being offered to other MDC 
components for utilization in the performance of government 
contract requirements.

Violations of these warranties must be avoided in our commercial 
pricing practices.

If we provide better prices to a commerical client we then must 
notify the government and provide such lower price(s) to them.  
Failure to do so could have serious repercussions for ISG and MDC 
based on various common law and statutory remedies for fraud or 
misrepresentation, including criminal and civil penalities for 
false statements or claims.

If information is neded as to the specific product and service 
offerings and the associated best catalog price discounts, please 
contact Jim McDaniel of my staff at (314) 233-6103 or in Jim's 
absence, the writer at 232-6850.  Specific GSA information can 
also be obtained from Harry Webb, Diversified business unit 
contract specialist, Vienna, Virginia at (703) 556-7909.

To:      ISG LISTS LEVEL A-E

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of 
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG 
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of 
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also 
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This 
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production 
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center 
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME 
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG 
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible 
         for informing their clients of significant service 
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to 
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and 
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer" 
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls 
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls 
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be 
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls 
         regarding network or operational problems will be 
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and 
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM, 
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by 
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business 
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning 
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in 
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers 
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This 
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for 
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number 
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number 
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority 
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in 
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not 
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an 
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing 
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be 
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business 
    Units.

Jerry McCoy and Ray Donahue found and fixed two hardware problems with the 
Army's KI - one module in the pager and one in the disk controller.  Bart
Wheeler, Ed Kochanowski, and I added patches to PULSAR up thru autopatch tape
7.  This is expected to lessen their problems with the weekly backup hanging
between reel changes.  The Army and PRC seemed pleased with the results.

I did an incremental of 930 today.  It appears that all the correct files

Subject: C26 crashes. 

Operations tell me that the first crash occurred when they took the ALL FILES
tapes that were written on C70 and mounted them on C26 in order to get a listing
(C70 is bogged down compared to C26).  The other two crashes (at FILAUS, alias
DECUMC+10) occurred when TITO was running "STORE (BILLING10)*.SAT".
It takes 1 hour 15 minutes to do a full DSKCLN on C26. 

I plan to use (CARL)DIRECT with /W/F to get the file names, then run TSTSUP
on each, looking for holes.

1-Jun-86 18:00/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Ops, David Jorgensen, (408)446-7705, System 26.
3 crashes in the last shift.  1 with no indication, 2 with stopcode FILAUS.
(FILAUS is in FILFND at DECUMC+10)  Checked JOB and $Q+JBTPRG in all crashes.
If the job was running TITO, then the file name and extension can be found in
.CPCAC+15 and .CPCAC+16 (contents of ACs 15 and 16 in AC block 0 on the KL).
Found references to the following files in (BILLING10): 052786.SAT, 052086.SAT,
050286.SAT.  All three files now have the NFS bit set so TITO will not touch
them.

Subject: System 62 status 

System 62 was out of commission due to some scribbling on the disk.

I rewrote APA0's 1st & 2nd HOM pages, copying them from APA1 and
making the appropriate changes.  Then, I re-created a rib page for
(SYS)SAT.SYS and brought the system up to TITO directories (HELGEM)
and (CARL).  The system went through a FULL DKSCLN without any
apparent problems...  If anyone lost files (other than Bill or myself)
I can only offer my sympathy.

Files I created late friday night appeared to be intact, so I doubt
anyone else lost anything.

Dennis Ernst is looking into the micronode problems... please record
any fatal node error messages, and if "1000G" works, or if the node
doesn't crash, please login as "XRAY:ST@" from the node's CTY and do
a "C" command.  Record the number "V=255,2" (for example) with the
fatal error.  At the moment, version 255,2 is the proper new version.

Problem:  Two recent crashes @19:11 CRA016 and @21:44 CRA017 showing a
          STOPCD APRFAT, NoMemory MemBusParity... but in CRA017 registers
          at .CPCAC+15,16 contained ONTR03.R00, from directory BETATEST.
          A CHKSUM of the file resulted in a crash.  Told OPS to send mail
          to the user and to have maintenance check out the APRFAT/CPU
          angle with a quick once-over.  File renamed to directory CRASH
          setting NFD.

Solution: Not really solved.. this problem has been cropping up more and
          more lately.

Subject: RMURPHY and GAN 3 

My understanding is that RMURPHY is working on the TUMS project... but
I don't know who he is or why he should have a GAN 3 username.  Another
GAN should be setup for this project or he should have a GAN from NTD,
not TYMCOM-X.  I realise that someone just did a GAN change on that user
but GAN 3 should NOT have been used.  Please rectify this, or have Ken
Jones (or whomever is running the show contact me).

Well, I don't know what's going on with RMURPHY.  I certainly didn't suggest
he be in GAN 3 or even know he was changing GAN for that matter.  In fact I
suggested he not do anything regarding validations and I was just going to
MOVUSR him to the systems he needed (with fixup).  At any rate, they don't
seem to be able to decide what to do:
  11/11/83 originally validate in GAN 11334
  4/11/85 canceled for a day - no other change
  5/3/86 revalidated with GAN 50527
  5/31/86 revalidated with GAN 3

The above events show that something went wrong in 930's base, and sent a

not have a chance to respond to the zap when the login request came in.  It
output the TTYZNE (Zapper Not Echoed) message and continued.  Then 6657 noticed
the problem, output its BFC message, reset itself, and waited for 930 to resync.
After 90 seconds of no activity in the IRING, 930 output the NOBASE message to
the CTY, which says "No response from base.  Please reload it.  PDP-10 is OK."
930 then reset IRPPDP, ORPPDP, IRP620, ORP620, and went thru its resync code.
This succeeded, producting the message BASEOK.

Subject: System 62 - Events 

During an attempt to do the all-files on 62, we kept losing vacuum on
the tape drive.  Steve Capik was called but has not yet arrived to date.

Last night, we decided to try the Kennedy 9400 drive that Dan & Eric
had sitting on the cart to see if it really was compatible and whether
the F3 could handle it.  Apparently, under timesharing, the 9400 works
just fine at 1600 or 6250 bpi.

Due to lack of an available working 9100 drive, we decided to see how much
tape an all-files took at 6250 and started the all-files.  It completed
this afternoon, and with the exception of one tape (accidently) written at
1600 bpi, the save took 6.5 tapes.  (5.5 @ 6250, 1 @ 1600).

I believe that the all-files takes less time as well, but we didn't really
perform any accurate timing tests.

/Carl

PS... it would be nice to be able to use a 9400 on one of our systems for
      all of the backups.....

Subject: Weirdies on system 62 

Joe,
    System 62 has some really weird problems with job #3, #5 and #7.  It
is possible that I can replicate the problem even further, but it tears
the system apart with "?error in detached job..." messages to the CTY
and OPR terminals, eating up to 60% of the CPU.  The IRONY is that SYSTAT
doesn't show anything.

  I was about to logoff and ran SY to see things at a glance, and WHOA..
there are 3 jobs, detached, running logout in ^C state.  So I try killing
them first with LOGOUT, then DDT and the HANG uuo, then TAKEIT... no dice
so I go to reload the system...  OOPS!

  Takeit sets the current terminal to OPR, and >Zap< >Zing< >Zowie< there
comes a flood of "?error in detached job..." messages all over the place.
Tons and tons of them... I finally got out of TAKEIT and zapped the OPR
port.  I then attached to the 3 jobs one at a time, couldn't run anything
at all (seems like no context pages? or something?) ...anyway, CORE 0 did
work, and by attaching, the "?error..." messages stopped going to the CTY
and OPR terminals.

  Jobs are still there, detached... I wanted to make sure we could get a
good crash somehow before we reload it.  Even if it means patching a good
copy of BOOTS into the monitor!!!

Subject: .iaFEX .iaECF et al 

Joe,
  It appears that I am able to detect .iaECF at least once by a single
frame, but have not had any luck in getting it to work repetedly.  I
made a small test program which run (JMS)SLEEP.SAV over and over in the
child frame waiting for any of: run bit off in JBTSTS, FEX detected,
ECF detected and LCF detected.  At no time was LCF ever seen although
I did kill the job each time in the test.

  The file (CARL:930)MSG.JMS run under the MUX on X62-P034/P28 shows the
results of the test.  FEX is detected reliably at the points that I want
to be able to detect ECF... ECF is detected once in the appropriate cases
but ONLY once!

  I did a find on JBYEXC and it is tied up with the HIBER UUO in both
PICON and SCNSER.  It is reasonable to assume that maybe ECF should be
enabled in the same way? (using channel 36, ugh) or another bit on the
hiber to detect it, not counting a hiber bit to detect FOCSI et al.

  We need to look at it more closely... because it is NOT reliable.

  Also, *BUG* in code at  INTAD1+some, SETZM JBTFNT##(J) should be a
MOVE T2,[777700000000] ANDM T2,JBTFNT##(J)  or something which doesn't
clear the 2 fields which are set by the parent, not the child...
  I'm sure this is not causing the problem in the test case, but it is
in need of repair.

Subject: Frame access rights, WAKE UUO 

I just don't believe this.....

To use the WAKE UUO, one needs to have .ARWAK rights over the other frame.
To have .ARWAK rights, one needs to BE the other frame or have WC license.

..just about every .ARxxx for doing anything to another frame needs to
have WC license.  this makes this UUO just about useless except for having
a process which sleeps waiting for various interrupts and then in the
proper interrupt receipt code, issues a WAKE UUO on itself so the main-line
code can process the interrupt at it's leisure.

I just don't believe this.....

Note to WRS... it's agreed that the FRAMING project was never completely
     implemented.  But, is there anything left of the design document (if
     there ever was a full design) that makes sense out of the various
     access rights as far as actual usage?  Does anything really use the
     created handles, setting various rights that doesn't already have
     lots of license (i.e. WC or RC).

Back to the WAKE.... since this is what started this...  TOPS-10 allows
a HIBER to enable for WAKE by self,same project or any job... I'd think
we should somehow allow that... although I realise we don't have any real
bits left to designate this... sigh!

Note to Joe... Does FRMOP function .FOCSI actually work yet?  I forget
     what you said the last time we talked about this.  It isn't crucial
     at the moment, waiting for the job to wake up (10 secs) won't hurt
     but it would be nice to do it in a more elegant way.  Giving WC to
     the SUBMIT program is the other alternative.... sigh.  Also, what
     access rights did you use for allowing .FOCSI?  Do we need access
     rights that take into account that the calling frame is one of:
	- a parent, - a child, - a sibling,
	- same ppn, - same gan, - same gan + account-supervisor
	- any other (non-family)
	- any other gan,uun
     that is, rights which because of these things, would permit other
     access rights to be enabled automatically.  For example, the parent
     should have certain privileges over any child, subject to variation
     based on JP.EXO (of course).

In-reply-to: your message of Sun, 22 Jun 86 0:13:01 PDT

FRMOP function .FOCSI=44 to Cause Software Interrupt works in P034/P29.
I modified (CARL:62)FRMTST.SAI to match the description in (M33:930)NEWUUO.NFO
and tested .IASIC (Software Interrupt from Child) and .IASIA (Software Interrupt
from Any).  I did not test .IASIP (from Parent) or .IASIS (from Sibling) but
they should work.  

This particular FRMOP function does not require any access rights whatsoever.
All that is required is for the target job to assign the appropriate interrupt
cause using FINASS.  Simpling setting .IASIA tells the Monitor that you are
willing to receive interrupts from anybody (any GAN, any UUN, any or no 
license).  It will even accept Software Interrupt from job 0!

Here is a case where it would be desirable to return from the HIBER uuo
(instead of resuming hibernation) after an INTADR interrupt had been processed.
I'm not sure whether the Monitor cancels the remaining sleep time or not.
I will check into this further.

Subject: Wake UUO 

According to my empirical testing (putting one job to sleep on the mux and
issuing a wake uuo on a second circuit) SLEEP always go to completion, ...
although I did not check to see what happens to a sleep-time during the
INTADR interrupts.  HIBER will NOT wake up unless you specify that a WAKE
will cause it to awaken, and you do need WC to use the WAKE uuo.

In effect, the frmop .FOCSI is a WAKE interrupt which must be enabled for
(as does HIBER) and requires no license to use.  If the WAKE uuo worked in
this fashion, we wouldn't really need the .FOCSI function.

Along these lines,  we'd like to eventually see a FINASS to allow software
interrupts for SELF, and same gan (with and/or without account supervisor).
Of course, same gan could be seen as sibling, but... not really.
These would be for completeness, but I don't see the need... no more than
for adding .IASIS (sibling).

In-reply-to: your message of Sun, 22 Jun 86 0:13:01 PDT

Ernie was very conservative with access rights with the intent to relax
most of them when the project was done.  The idea was to keep people
outside the group from writting code taking advantage of things that were
subject to change or were going away.  I don't think there were any
motivational documents ever created.

The WAKE UUO used to work on any frame without any license.  The worst
damage one could do with it is waste resources by looping sending wakes
to everybody.  That's no worse than looping except that other people will
be billed for the TRUs.  However, I think that one needs a mechanism
that allows any unpriv'd program to send a wake signal.  I propose that
WAKE be it.  There also exists CLUB wake which provides excellent
capabilities for cooperating programs.  Remember that one of the most
common uses for WAKE is to signal that you've left something for the
other program in some file or sharred memory.  CLUBS are perfect for that
since you can join the CLUB based on a sharred file/memory page and
this solves the otherwise tedious and nondeterministic problem of
trying to get the frame numbers of the other jobs.  And then there is
the new stuff you're adding.  I think all the bases are pretty well
covered.  Don't overlook CLUBS it is THE way to manage sharred access
to a file or queue!

I think it does, but not by canceling the sleep time.  At any rate, I think
it should be consistent in that HIBER should behave the same for all INTADR

System 38 experienced many SIMUUF stopcodes today when MIS people GFD'd

the culprit.  (MAGNUM?)  They have a July 1st deadline have have to have the
system up.  To allow them to stay up, I patched SIMUUF to be an INFO stopcode
that halts the job and lets the system stay up.

Subject: TAUX should not use / or # as a switch character. 

I found some interesting facts when looking to see what characters can be
used to specify optional switches to programs that parse usernames.  Page 6
of the NETVAL ERS says usernames can be up to 20 characters, they can contain
the letters A-Z, digits 0-9, " ", "#", "&", "*", "$", ",", ".", "/".  Note
that slash and poundsign are part of the username, a comma is legal but not
recommended (in case the user wants to build a circuit from X.25 to TYMNET).

It also says that the dash "-" is ignored on aux circuits.  If you try to
build an aux circuit to "LINK-10", the sup ignores the hyphen, looks up the
name "LINK10", and completes the circuit.  If the username has a hyphen in
it, (such as "NTD-SECURITY"), then NOBODY can build an aux circuit to that
name (the sup says that "NTDSECURITY" is not in the MUD).

This is an interesting way to build usernames that not even AC license can
crack.					/JMS

The command "SENDMAIL MONITOR" can no longer be used.  You have to use the

Subject: Update to RESET.PAT and /P-12 

We may be on the right track, but Roy Roskilly's problem showed that the
SIMUUF crashes haven't been completely fixed.  The JRST .+3 was not in error.

The code at RELEA5 uses the UXCTBU macro, which I confused with the XCTBU
macro.  The latter generates one word of in-line code, but UXCTBU produces
	PUSHJ P,DOXCT
	XCT N,[INSTRUCTION]

DOXCT sets the "previous context user" flag (PC.UIO) if necessary so that
the INSTRUCTION refers to the user's address space, even for nested MUUOs.

I have changed the instruction at RELEA5+5 from JRST RELEA5+7 back to its
original JRST RELEA5+10, but left the other two word in RESET.PAT.
NEWMON and all running monitors have been repatched, Roskilly's test on
D56 works now.

Back to the drawing board.		/Joe

Bonnie at Fremont Ops had a problem trying to run TAKEIT on F30.  It complained

for her.

I GFD'd to OPER and ran (SYS)QUOLST, which reported that the OPER directory
had exceeded its logged-in quota by 125 pages.  The biggest file there was
FTA1 and it had 24936 pages.  I deleted this file at Bonnie's request.

In this case, TAKEIT should have output the message "Cannot create temporary
file because directory (OPER) is full".  Or suggest that the user GFD to a
different directory and try again.

The problem with XEXEC/EXECX where the stack (ac '17) is clobbered is
happenning when I go to convert a ppn to a username by
looking up the UFD and extracting the name from the rib.  I setup the
appropriate open block and perform an "XCT 2"  where
2 contains "CHANIO 3,addr"    3 contains 13,,2 which is .chOPN,,2
and addr contains an open block.

after the XCT, ac '17 is 0.  Either the XCT or the CHANIO itself is
somehow clobbering register 17.  I even typed  "CHANIO 3,addr$x" myself
and saw that register 17 was cleared.

I am reloading system 62 with /P-10 to determine if the monitor is causing
this problem...

Subject: Unit types in BPXKON and CPXKON. 

Each disk driver can return 2 bits of unit type to the monitor, allowing
a single driver to handle up to 4 different types if disks.  The 2 bits are
set by the capacity test, which is called from ONCDSK via PUSHJ P,@KONCPY(J).
The capacity test is a routine named BPXCPY in both BPXKON and CPXKON.

BPXKON does one test - it attempts to seek to cylinder 500.  If it gets an
error, it know it is talking to a 3670 (alias 3330 mod I) which as 440 cylinders
and holds 100 megabytes.  (We no longer have any disks of this type, although
the code is still there, and in PAKCOP.)  If the seek to cylinder 500 succeeds,
BPXKON assumes that it is talking the a 3675 (alias 3330 mod II, or Ampex 830).
This 200 megabyte disk has 880 cylinders, and is on all our systems except for
C26.  BPXKON knows that these devices have 19 heads, with 18 blocks per track.

When I created CPXKON from BPXKON, I modified the first test and added a second.
It now attempts to seek to cylinder 600.  If this succeeds, CPXKON assumes it
is talking to a 3675 (3330-II) 200 megabyte disk.  If it fails, CPXKON assumes
it is talking to a 3650, 300 megabyte disk.  Note that the 100 megabyte disk
is not supported.  The second test is to read the COUNT field of record 1 on
cylinder 0 track 0.  If it says the record consists of 576 bytes, it is 
formatted in blocks of 128 words each.  If it says the record consists of 2304
bytes, then it is formatted in pages of 512 words each.  Any other value 
indicates an improperly formatted disk.

As currenlty implemented, the 4 types of disks that CPXKON recognizes are
3675 in blocks, 3675 in pages, 3650 in blocks, and 3650 in pages.  (3650 in
blocks is a combination we do not want to support.)  By adding another test
to CPXKON (a seek to cylinder 900), then it could recognize a 3652 which 1110
cylinders (but is otherwise identical to the 3650).  That would make the 4
types of disks supported be 3675 in blocks, 3675 in pages, 3650 in pages, and
3652 in pages.

At this point, there is some question as to whether the 3652 has a native mode.
The Memorex manual "3674 Storage Control Unit Theory of Operations Manual"
3674.21-02 (PN 804332) says that the 3652 can emulate two 3650 volumes, or two
3675 volumes.  This may mean that the 3652 does not have a native mode, but
the manual does not explicitly state so.  All it has is a note, "For an
explanation of 3652 or 3644 emulation modes consult the appropriate Theory of
Operations Manual (3644.21 or 3652.21)."  We need to obtain this manual or
ask a Memorex representative for clarification.

If we can keep a counter of how many DDBs we have created, added to the DDB

Why not do once a minute code while catching up on time?  Unless it only
checks against uptime counters instead of actual clock time...  it could
confuse people who do DAYTIME commands...

(in particular, inactivity timeouts)


What happens to characters other than ^Z typed on the CTY in NETWORK mode?


What is th actual format of the SYSUDT variable, NSWTBL+5... is it the UDT
the system came up or the TDT?   KSYS is still ticks to system reload, right?

Can I assume that /P32 works?

I have a message from Peter (Stratman?) from CEGI asking about upgrading
their systems to /P (actually whatever is needed for XEXEC) and about some
testing of XEXEC on their systems.  I think that we need to clarify our
support picture with CEGI (or whatever they're now called) before we take
any action.

Re:  My pass on annual review...

Craig,
  I am still not feeling well, and will NOT be in today (Friday), so it
will be impossible to give you anything by today.  I will try to come in
(at least on Sunday, when I do the incremental) and work on the review
so you will have the first pass to go over on Monday morning.

  I've pretty much been resting, sleeping or running a small fever since
Monday evening and have not been getting any work done.  I will give you
a recount of sick vs. work hours for the payroll records on monday (since
I did take my weekend on Wednesday & Thursday even thought I was sick).

  Leave me mail if you have any questions... I am going back to sleep for
now.  /Carl

Subject: SZRPT.MAC is a mess. 

The author of SZRPT really screwed up.  Look at the following:
	T1=6
	T2=7
	LS=12
	T3=13
	54=54
	UFDBF=12
	MFDBF=13
...
	ARRAY UFDBF[3],MFDBF[3]
...
	CALLI
	INIT UF,17
	SIXBIT /DSK/
	UFDBF
	  JRST ...
...
GTUFD1:	MOVE T1,UFDBLK(UFDBF)
...
The coding is atrocious.  It's a wonder it works at all.  (In fact, it doesn't
even wait for an answer when it asks for "sort by").  It looks very much as if
the program was written before the CHANIO function that reads the UFD.  Then
someone added the .CHUFD call, which made the 3-word buffer header for reading
the UFD in buffered mode obsolete, so that person decided to reuse the name
UFDBF, but did not purge all the previous references to the symbol.

As currently coded, SZRPT attempts to use two overlaping buffer headers in the
ACs, which causes it to die with "?Address check for device at user PC 174"
when running under the /P33 monitor.  Since this program is so blatently wrong,
I will put a new version of SZRPT on SYS, and not retract the edit to the
Monitor that caught this problem.   /Joe

Subject: P034/P33-1 has hang fixed. 

My fault.  I started to re-arrange the dispatch table for the base-to-host
messages, got part way thru, then changed my mind.  I undid the changes except
for the case when we get a message type 5 = New Supervisor has taken over the
node.  The <AOJA P4,SCNIN1> was missing, causing SCNSER to POPJ without
advancing the IRING pointer, therefore it saw the same message over and over
and did not do anything about it.  24XP33 and 26XP33 have been patched on
M33 on their respective systems.  The /P33-1 monitor will not have this
particular hang problem anymore.		/Joe

          call the hotline was not cancelled.  Anyway, they got a SIMUUF
          stopcode while running the /P19-4 monitor, which means that RESET.PAT
          has not solved the problem.  Told them to reload from SYSTEM.SAV,
          no further notification necessary.  26XP33 still not tested?

SUBJECT>   OnTyme Version 22


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


    Applied Communications Systems (ACS) is pleased to announce that
    version 22 of OnTyme will be deployed for customers beginning in
    August!  The following features and enhancements have been added.
 
    SUBJECT LINE.  On a :SEND or :REPLY the system will prompt for
    subject.  The subject text supplied by the sender will appear in
    the message header and all the message lists (:IN, :OUT, old,
    long, short, etc.).
 
    X.ONTYME.  This feature is an interface with which applications,
    PC "front ends", or intelligent terminal procedures may interact
    with OnTyme in a consistent, reliable, binary, machine-oriented
    format.
    
    PATHWAY.  This feature allows the user to log into any network
    host during an OnTyme session, capture data from the target host
    into the OnTyme workspace, transfer data between OnTyme and the
    network host, and execute commands on the host. The target host
    may reside in either the same network as OnTyme or in another
    network accessible through a gateway.
 
    XMODEM.  This feature is used for binary file transfer using the
    XMODEM protocol.
 
    SYSTEM GENERATED MESSAGES.  Version 22 of OnTyme will put a
    message in the :IN list of the sender regarding invalid recipients
    so they will no longer have to look through their :OUT (OLD) lists.
 
    RESERVED CHARACTERS. To facilitate future enhancements, six
    characters (!,@,#,$,%,&) will no longer be allowed in file names.
    These will be used later as 'wildcard' characters for displaying
    information with the :LIST command.
 
    :REPLY (cc)(msg#).  This command will send the contents of the
    workspace to the original recipients of msg#.
 
                                                                Page  2

    COMMAND SCANNER. The OnTyme code has been improved and made more
    efficient.  Many system messages have been grammatically improved
    and made more consistent.
 
    Version 22 is available on the Marketing test host so that you can
    become familiar with the new product features. To request a
    temporary id on the test host, send a request to ACS.ONTYME.
 
    More complete documentation is being written and included in user
    manuals, technical manuals, and *** files in OnTyme as
    appropriate.  Definitions of the enhancements in version 22 of
    OnTyme may be found in the public file *** ONTYME.NEWS. Please
    distribute this announcement within your organization.  
 
 
    Version 22 WARNING!
    -------------------
    All 'intelligent front end' processes should be adequately tested
    for compatibility with version 22 of OnTyme before August 1.  
 
    ACS will provide technical assistance to complete this test.  To
    provide the longest possible lead time for any necessary code
    conversions, please schedule these tests as soon as possible.  Ids
    on the Marketing test host are now available upon request from
    ACS.ONTYME. Please keep ACS.ONTYME informed of the results.
 
    There are two enhancements in version 22 of OnTyme that have the
    POTENTIAL of disrupting 'intelligent front end' processes such as
    OnTyme :EXEC procedures, PC based packages, and intelligent
    terminal procedures that match on the text of OnTyme messages or
    the format of the :SEND, :REPLY, :IN and :OUT commands.  
    
    First, the text of many of the more obscure (not frequently
    encountered) system and error messages has been revised for
    grammatical improvement and consistencey. The most common messages
    such as ACCEPTED and ALL MESSAGES READ have not been changed.  You
    may obtain a list of the text changes by sending a request to
    ACS.ONTYME.  In the event that an incompatibility is found between
    a front-end process and version 22, ACS will urge that the
    X.ONTYME protocol be adopted in the front-end to preclude any
    future problems.  Use of X.ONTYME will fix the problem once and
    for all.  Please :READ *** ONTYME22.XONTYME for further
    information about this protocol.
    
    Second, each OnTyme session will default to having subject line
    enabled.  Each :SEND or :REPLY command will be followed by a
    prompt for subject.  The format of the :IN and :OUT lists will
    change to show a subject line for each message.  The subject line
    feature may be disabled at the session level providing a very
    simple solution to any compatibility problems caused by subject
    line.  Please :READ *** ONTYME22.SUBJLINE for further information
    about the subject line feature.
 
    Please direct any questions about this announcement to ACS.ONTYME.
 
    Thank you.

Many of our employees and visitors prefer to conduct their 
business in a smoke-free atmosphere.  While we respect each 
individual's right to smoke or not, we are also responsible for 
providing a comfortable, safe and healthy workplace.

The following guidelines are an attempt to appropriately balance 
the preferences of both smokers and nonsmokers.

    o    Employees who smoke should do so primarily in their 
         immediate work areas, should respect the wishes of their 
         fellow employees, and should observe all designated 
         no-smoking areas.

    o    Employees may designate their office/cubicle or work area 
         as a smoking or no-smoking area.  "No Smoking" signs are 
         available through stationery.

    o    Smoking is not permitted in elevators, hallways, 
         libraries and restrooms.

    o    Smoking will not be permitted in meetings or classes, 
         unless the meeting leader determines that it is agreeable 
         to all participants.

    o    Smoking will be permitted in designated areas within 
         breakrooms, dining areas (other than the food service 
         areas), lobbies and reception areas, provided that these 
         areas are properly ventilated.  Such areas must be 
         clearly designated and have adequate separation from 
         no-smoking areas.

    o    Smoking is not permitted in areas where it would endanger 
         lives, damage equipment and/or otherwise pose a safety 
         hazard.  These areas will be designated accordingly.

    o    Management has the responsiblity to resolve disputes 
         which may arise and to make reasonable accommodations for 
         all employees.



Page 2


In addition to these guidelines, all ISG organizations must ensure 
that smoking policies for their work locations are in accordance 
with any local government ordinances.

The successful implementation of this policy will require your 
cooperation, courtesy and accommodation of individual 
preferences.  Questions regarding this policy should be directed 
to your local Human Resources organization.

Problem:  UIL stopcode with memory errors.  Deselected sector of memory, then
          got "Inconsistant Hash Constant" and "Too many last logical units"
          and "Logical unit 89 missing from DSKB".

Solution: Went on-site set breakpoints and check the home pages.  DSKB11
          messed up.  Of the 24 nonzero words in the HOM page, all but 5 were
          zero.  The check for missing logical units gets into an infinite loop
          if HOMLUN does not match HOMLOG.  Patched the HOM page on BPA13.
          Came up in CONSOL mode, ran DSKCLN in CHECK mode.  It complained that
          unit 9 was missing RIB pointers.  Put them in using (SPL)FILDDT.
          DSKCLN ran on in check mode, recycled and ran FULL DSkCLN at 8:30am.

 Osman,

 I sent you a message on system 26, but incase you did not get it I will
repeat my findings here.

 I logged into system 26 for about an hour (40 times or so) and the
system did not crash. I noted one small point that maybe worth a mention,
a few times when the server set read file, not all of the "did not set"
message was printed IE.

of the patch untill a better solution is found. Suits me!

Subject: Solved some of the APRFAT and UIL stopcodes. 

Osman and I tracked down the cause some of the APRFAT and UIL stopcodes.
It starts when a user in Great Britain uses a menu server to login and set
status.  Apparently a leave-deferred-echo message catches up to input characters
with all the satellite delays.  In any case, SCNSER sees message type 15 when
it is not ready for it.  On the KLs running P034/P-12, this causes a TTYZNE
info stopcode, with contents of P1 = 15 (the system stays running).  On the
KIs, any INFO stopcode turns off paging and causes a UIL halt stopcode.  On
C26-P034/P19-4, the INFO stopcode runs to completion, but accidently sets the
NXM flag causing an APRFAT stopcode at the next clock tick.

For C26, putting a JFCL at LDEC+2 in SCNSER will avoid the INFO stopcode.
For the KI systems, (M33)INFOKI.PAT will make INFO stopcodes work.

It is possible that the menu server is not strictly following TYMNET-II
protocol in respect to green balls and deferred echoing.  Since it tells the
host it has echoed the characters it is sending (but really doesn't), I
suspect the menu server.  We need to come up with a better way for SCNSER
to handle this problem.

The file (M33)P33TMP.PAT shows what has been patched to solve the problems
found in the /P33 monitor.  I don't plan to make a /P34 until I find out why
INFO stopcodes set the NXM flag on the KL.  INFO stopcodes work find on the F3,
the KS, and now that SVSETS has been patched, the KI.  It may be in the code
that reads S-bus diags from all possible memory controllers (code borrowed from
TOPS-10 which may not be worth keeping on TYMCOM-X).

In the past few months, there has been considerable discussion 
over two ISG-wide issues:

    o    When will merit increases be reinstated?

    o    What changes, if any, will be made in the ISG Employee 
         Savings Plan?

The purpose of this memo is to let you know where things stand 
regarding these issues.

We plan to resume ISG's merit review program in January 1987.  
While I cannot provide details just yet, I can assure you that 
whatever process we use will address the fact that some 
individuals have gone longer than others without a merit review.  
I realize that the suspension of such review has been, at best, a 
major inconvenience for all of us.  However, it really has 
bettered our chances of achieving ISG's earnings objective.  I'm 
counting on your continued patience until we've finished the job 
we set out to do this year.

As for the ISG Employee Savings Plan, you received word several 
months ago that we were considering changes in the way matching 
contributions are handled.  After careful study, however, we have 
decided to make no changes in the plan at this time.

Subject: MONED1 working again. 

There is a bug in the GETMAP routine, which maps file pages into memory.
Aparently it will not allow more than 12 pages to be mapped.

When MONED1 is reading P034.MEM backwards from the end, it looks for the
latest number like "/P29".  Then it looks for the major version number, such
as "P034/Q".  If the major version number is 12 pages from the end of the
file, then MONED1 dies trying to map SYSID.DAT.  If the major number is more
than 12 pages from the end, then MONED1 dies trying to find it.

My work-around was to duplicate the text "P034/Q" closer to the end of the
file.  To prevent this from happening again, we need to either 1) Fix MONED1
to not use GETMAP, or 2) Release monitors more often.

Subject: Misc BACKUP & MONED1 

Backup schedules...
  incrementals every day sounds nice, but it does take time and
requires physical access to the machine...

  as we are being paid a bit more than operators, we should try to
minimize our "operations" tasks as much as possible.  ALL-FILES are
a fact of life... and once a month is the minimum we can get by on.
incrementals, on the other hand vary depending on how much work we
do on our machines.  Since there are only 4 of us, I feel that four
times a week (unless we have a special case) is enough giving each
of us one turn at it each week.

  we should look at the amount of work done on a daily basis on each
machine (in general) and decide when the 4 optimal times to backup
the system are taking into consideration what time of day each of us
would be dong the backup.
  (clearly, my backing up the system last thing on Sunday, and someone
else backing up the system first thing on Monday isn't very good...)

As long as I work Saturday & Sunday, I feel a backup of my work as I
finish up on Sunday lets us start the week fresh.  Tuesday afternnon
(after our weekly meeting) sounds like another good time, since we all
try to get things finished up for the tuesday meeting "show & tell".
I'm not sure when the other two "best" times ought to be...  anyone
have any better suggestions...?


Re: MONED1 -- Good work... I'm suprised we didn't run into this on the
    /K monitor release... must have barely made it with /J64 under the
    wire.  We've also been a bit more verbose than on previous releases
    of the monitor and that probably accounts for /P32 too far from
    the end.

    Now that you mention it, GETMAP does have that restriction on the
    number of pages... I wonder if it is limited to 12, or if it can
    just be changed to a larger number...  anyway, if I plug in the
    VMFILE routines, it won't matter since it only keeps one page mapped
    at a time (just like SIMIO).

some employees indicated that they did not receive Jerry 
Causley's letter of July 24, 1986, and still wanted to contribute 
SBI ideas.  (To get a copy of Jerry's letter, contact Lorna Loram 
at 408/446-8825.)
 
All employees are welcome to submit their ideas for an SBI for 
the ISG.  All submissions will be combined with the ideas 
generated at the brainstorming sessions held last week at various 
ISG facilities, and will be reviewed by the ISG Management 
Committee during the week of September 8.  Ideas can be submitted 
prior to August 28 via two methods:
 
        . Mail your idea to:
               
                    SBI Ideas
                    Bldg. 306-2E, Room 278
                    P.O. Box 516
                    St. Louis, MO 63166
 
        . Use Ontyme to submit your idea; type
 
                    :EXEC *** FORMS.SBI/IDEA
 
Questions about the SBI process can be directed to me (408/446-
7811) or the User Support Center in St. Louis (314/232-6943).

31-Aug-86 5:20 am /Carl
Caller:   Building C OPS, 408-446-7705, System 26

Problem:  MAPAL1 stopcode (2 - 1st @ 1:00am, 2nd @ 5:xx am) while doing
          the all-files store to tape.

          Both crashes listed problems with memory box 113 error in
          sec 3, port 7 -- (memory reset) BEFORE taking a crash dump.

Solution: Ran TITO/TTR on 2nd tape of the allfiles and did a directory to
          see the last file stored to tape.
          Ran DIRIT with the command "DIR (BILLING10)/UNSORTED" to find
          the file(s) in the same vicinity of the last file stored to the
          tape.  (TTR reported an I/O error before reaching the checksum
          on the last file, indicating that it started the file but DID NOT
          finish the store).
          Ran CKSUM on the "next" presumably good file without error.
          Renamed the "bad" file to (CRASH) and ran LKBDDT to set NFS and NDL
          on the file so that TITO would not try to back it up, and noone
          would accidently try to delete it and have page-deallocation crash
          the system.

Background: Last all-files was done on 8/16/86.  We were running /P19-5 on
            the 15th, /P33-5 on the 16th, and /P34 on the 24th.

            The BAD NEWS is that the bad file was (BILLING10)082686.SAT
            which must have been created after we started running /P34.

I noticed several garbled mail messages, so I hung 930, stopped its microcode
long enough for the base to notice, and then reloaded the F3.  The problem is
something in P034/P34 that affects all processors - COMMON does not clean up
after itself when taking the system down like is used to.  In the process of
fixing that, I will look into passing more information across reloads.  Such

The following is from the July 86 edition of DIGEST Training Update & Schedule.

	TOPS-10/20 training programs, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
	For registration call Boston (617)276-4380.

EY-5266E-LO  TOPS-10/20 Basic Assembly Language Programming
  5 days, $1300, 4-Aug-86

EY-5267E-LO  TOPS-10 Advanced Assembly Language Programming
  5 days, $1300, 11-Aug-86

EY-5268E-LO  TOPS-10 Monitor Internals for version 7.03
  10 days, $2600, 6-Oct-86+13-Oct-86

EY-5273E-LO  ANF-10 Networking
  5 days, $1300, 8-Sep-86

The only other classes are for TOPS-20 and for DECnet Phase IV.  It appears
that DEC has discontinued the TOPS-10 System Administrator and the TOPS-10
Operator classes.  I would recommend calling the Boston number and asking.

I suppose that if Brett were to ask Craig in writing that I would be made
available for teaching more clases on Operator Training.  The System
Administrator class would be a little more difficult due to the nonstandard
accounding programs.

Craig,

  EY-5268E-LO  TOPS-10 Monitor Internals for 7.03
  is 10 days, scheduled for 20-Oct-86

  There is space remaining for 10 people at the moment.

  To register, the following is required:
  1) Student Name     ;   Carl A Baltrunas
  2) Company Name     ;   McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company
  3) Mailing Address  ;   39100 Liberty Street
     for confirmation ;   Fremont, CA  94538

  4) if paying with purchase order, the PO number and a copy of the PO
     to be sent prior to the class start date, the company will be billed
     after the class is complete.
     if paying with a company check, the check should be received prior
     to the class start date.

  I presume we will be paying with a PO, so I could not register myself
  today.  Please initiate whatever needs to be done to get a PO number
  and we can call them and register me then.

  I did not verify the price, $2600, and I suggest we do that since the
  schedule was apparently changed since the last catalogue printing, the
  price may also have changed.

PS.
  I will try to give Craig a call on Tuesday.

floppy disk drive and connected it to system 95.  The we could take the KL
BOTLOD program, transfer it to the 2020 via magtape, write it on the floppy,
take the floppy to the data center, and copy it to KLDCP DECtape.

Subject: BADSAT/MAPAL1 problem located. 

When a bad SAT is detected, the Monitor sets some flags so that it will not
use any of the 9216 pages the SAT refers to.  The system continues, and will
request a full DSKCLN next time to rebuild the SAT from scratch.
There are two ways a SAT can be marked bad.  If there is a read error, then
the count of bad SAT reads in SATBRD is incremented.  If the count from SATCNT
is not correct, then T4 does not match STTFPC.  In all the crashes I looked at,
SATBRD was zero, as was STRDDB+1, which should have pointed to BPA0CB.

Before P034/P21         After P034/P21       ;3/6/86
ADDM T1,UNITAL(U)       ADDM T1,UNITAL(U)    ;Reduce available pages on unit
                        HRRZ T2,UNISTR(U)    ;Point to right STRDDB
ADDM T1,STRTAL+STRDDB   ADDM T1,STRTAL(T3)   ;Reduce avail pages on structure
SETZM STTFPC(T2)        SETZM STTFPC(T2)     ;Zero free page count for SAT

That should have been "HRRZ T3,UNISTR(U)".  The typo T2 to be changed, STRDDB+1
to be zeroed, and MAPAL1 stopcode when the next user got a page fault.
I have patched SYSTEM and NEWMON to be C26-P034/P33-6 and C26-P034/P34-1.

This is a reminder that the monitor work to standardize the home, bad and

on a newer boots for each type, so that should be done.

For the KS, the monitor tools, KSFEFS and friends, are still setup to use
the old page asignments and need to be checked, changed and/or tested to
insure that we do not have any conflicts.

The changes were made to the monitor at the same time SPAGES.SYS was put
into the sources.  I know what I've done, so whomever gets the task of
figuring out where things are, which are done and which are not should
talk to me when they get around to working on this.

Osman and I talked with Ed Roop and Bill Fischer yesterday.  Ed wondered
when the PERP replacement would be under test as he would like to try
removing one PERp controller by mid October and have the new version on
the affected -10's by then.

Will you be sure to contact the right people on 36 or 39 to see that we
can begin testing by 27 september.

     IPC IS PLANNING TO SHUTDOWN THE CUPERTINO DATA CENTER BETWEEN NOW
AND JUNE 1987.  ALL SYSTEMS AT THE CENTER WILL BE DISTRIBUTED EITHER TO    
THE FREMONT OR DALLAS CENTER. 
     
     EACH SYSTEM'S USER LOAD WILL BE TRANSFERRED AS A SINGLE UNIT, RATHER  
THAN BY INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER MOVES.  THIS WILL KEEP THE SYSTEM MOVE TRANS-  
PARENT TO THE USER, WITH LITTLE EFFECT.  MOST OF THE MOVES WILL OCCUR 
DURING WEEKENDS.

PROMOTION   OF   CHRIS   SPAMPINATO  AS  MANAGER,  TECHNICAL  SUPPORT
ORGANIZATION

It  is  my  pleasure to announce the promotion of Chris Spampinato to
the  position  of Manager, Technical Support Organization-Irvine, for
the  Field  Service  Company,  reporting  directly  to  me  effective
immediately.

Due  to  the  recent  structural  change  of  the  Technical  Support
Organization,  Chris  assumes  the  responsibility  for  the  product
support departments within the Irvine location.

Chris  will focus on providing product and technical support for both
hardware  and  software.  The  major thrust will be in support of CSC
products,  but  will  also  include  third  party product evaluation,
excluding DEC products.

Chris's  previous  management  responsibilities  included  Department
Manager,  Technical  Support,  and  Manager, Marketing Field Support.
Chris joined the Company in 1979 as a Technical Support Analyst.

Please join me in wishing Chris success in her new assignment.

William H. Kersten
Vice President
Technical Operations
McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company

CONCURRENCE:

Vern H. Hart
President
McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company

(end forwarded message)

Craig,
   What does this mean?  Do you still report to Kersten?  ...or are
you the "unofficial" T.S.O.-Fremont manager?  Or is our new group name
mentioned in today's meeting mean we are now a different group...

I'm confused.

Subject: Can't login over shut to Fayez. 

After asking Fayez-Sarofim to bring up the system using KMCMAN, I was unable
to login.  I received the following:
        please log in: jms:370;
        shut ^G
        host shut
        please log in:
They must be running a version of LOGINN that does not allow login over shut.

This is the procedure they use to bring up the system normally:

        BOOTS:CONSOL            Load SYS:CONSOL.SAV
        >CONS                   Go into CONSOLE mode
        please log in: ^Z L OPER

        !R NODLOD               Reload the KMC
        !R RELOAD               This zeros sense-switch 4 and loads SYSTEM.SAV
        BOOTS:(SYS)SYSTEM.SAV   This is automatic as a result of RELOAD.SAV
        DSKCLN runs

At one time, the only way you could run NODLOD on a 2020 was by running a
special monitor (SYS)CONSOL.SAV that had the CIOPR uuo implemented.  I don't
know if KMCLOD.SAV will run on H370-P034/J-5.  The version of INITIA they have
does not attempt to run KMCLOD.  Note that if the operator is unable to set
license, then he can't run NODLOD or RELOAD, therefor DSKCLN does not get run.

The problem started when the disk got clobbered, and the operator restored all
files from a backup tape after using "O GOD" instead of REFLAG.  They are
restoring all files now.                /Joe

Subject: Bug in (SPL)MAP causes BOOTS to fail! 

I got "READ ERR OR EOF" consistantly from BOOTS after I had used (SPL)MAP
to copy F3XP37.SAV to (SYS)NEWMON.SAV on 930 (and 62XP37.SAV on 62).
If you do "DIRECT (SYS)NEWMON.*/WORDS" you will see that the BAD file is
exactly 512 words too short, and the size of the good file is a multiple
of 512 words long.  I had to use either COPY or GET/SAVE to duplicate this
monitor.

Carl,
  When is MAP going to be fixed to rescan the command line?  The DUPLICATE
command is already in the monitor waiting for a new DUPLIC.SAV to be put
on SYS:.       /Joe

Subject: Problems restoring C70's all-files to C24. 

 2-Oct-86 04:06/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, L.T. Smith, System C24
Problem:  He refreshed the disks on 24, and started restoring all files from
          C70's backup tapes.  TITO restored all UFDs, all of SYS, then died
          with stopcode IME in the middle of directory BAILEY on the first tape.
Diagnosis: This happens on all systems - after REFRESH, there is a limited
          number of SATs that can be kept in core and none are written out.
          When the last in-core SAT is filled up, the system dies with IME,
          and you have to run a FULL DSKCLN.  Then the operator has to get
          ALL license (without using REFLAG!) and resume restoring.

Fix:      I ran TSTSUP (it and DECDDT are on SYS on all systems as of 25-Sep)
          and found that page 0 of [1,1].UFD had been overwritten with garbage.
          Probably when the monitor stepped all over itself when the SATs
          filled up.  Told LT to do the following:
          1. Get a directory of the all-files tape to find where SYS ends
          2. Refresh DSKB again
          3. Restore from tape positions 1-<end of SYS>
          4. Run BOOTS to write BOOT.KI to home pages
          5. Take the system down
          6. Bring up the system and run a FULL DSKCLN
          7. Find someone who has an OPER name with all license
          8. Finish restoring rest of all-files

-----------------------------------------------------------------
With the upcoming moves, it is critical that we get a new version of TITO
out to SYS, one with a single change: TITO must type the starting and ending
positions for each directory when doing STORE ALL or RESTORE ALL.

And we have got to come up with a better way of giving the operator all
license when they have to RESTORE ALL.

Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, L.T. Smith, System C24
Problem:  BADSAT, [1,1].UFD messed up, etc. when doing RESTORE of C70's files.
          One of the disks had gone off-line, reports of BADSAT on other disks.
Diagnosis: Ran TSTSUP, word 25 of page 1 pointed to [1,1].UFD RIB at page 20712.
          Word 51 of that page pointed to UFD data page for hash 0, it was
          200006,,000012 - the first non HOM page on DSKB3.  That particular
          page was full of ASCII text, TYMSAT engine code in particular.
          Something crumped on the SAT for DSKB3 again allowing the Monitor
          to write over (UFD) again.
Fix:      Turned off RBREAL in RIB pointer (making it 6,,12).  Told operations
          to run another FULL DSKCLN, restore the UFD section of the tape again,
          and resume restoring from where they left off.
Followup: As of noon Friday, TITO was in the middle of restoring (MOORING).
          System uptime 9:35.  PSP reports 952145 pages free, no errors.

Subject: PAKCP5 works! 

I located the reason why PAKCP5 would not correctly write HA and R0 (Home
Address and Record 0) on 3650's.  There were two off-by-one bugs in the code
I added (unfortunately they did not cancel each other out).

I located the reason why PAKCP5 and PAKCP3 could not write the secondary
HOM and BAT pages.  Code written a long time ago to handle RECSIZ=^D152 used
the wrong half of the accumulator when RECSIZ=PAGSIZ.

I fixed both, refreshed the alternate tracks on unit 315, and successfully
copied 314 to 315.  Now we have two copies of system 24's DSKB14 on those
two units.  Neither one is usable as is, but the copy worked!

The next step is to verify 3675 packs formatted with PAKCP3 in pages work
with CPXKON.  After that, make a single PAKCOP that can handle all three
formats.

Contact:  Dallas Operations, (214)637-7435, Greg Moran, D34
Problem:  PAM not running, (UTIL)GOPJ would not start it.
Diagnosis: Tried "TAUX PJ:34" from system 34, got "?access barred".
          This means that D34's base (node 6703) is not in the list of
          TYMSHARE nodes.  The supervisor says 6703 is not in the class list
          valid for PJ.
Fix:      Logged into D23, set AC license, "R (SPL)TAUX" and "PJ:34".
          This is a temporary hack until Validations adds node 6703 to list.

Joe, re.  C70:  I have replaced a damaged copy of (SYS)EDITOR.SHR with a good
copy from another host.  Barbara, in bldg C, told me about the file in (SYS)
on C70 (file RECOV.SYS) which lists some files reported as having 'data
missing'.  The file appears to be output of DSKCLN (or something similar), and
lists 6 files from (SYS), and one file from (M33).  Although the file is on
C70, it says it is data from host C24.  I have looked at the referenced files
with DIRIT and CKSUM, on C70 and other hosts.  The files look O.K., and I've
received no user complaints.  I'm assuming the files are now O.K.  The files
are:

(SYS)COPLUD.LOW, EXIT.SAV, PIP.LOW, SSPICE.SAV, UUOSYM.UNV, FTUPDL.SAV
(M33)CRSHID.LOG (this created 5-oct-86)

I tried many various commands, then discovered that there were two versions of

version 21, is the culprit.  The correct version is in (SYS)TELECO.SAV, version
22.3, last modified in 1986.

I have deleted the obsolete version of TELECOPY from FTSYS.  Let me know if
this solves the problem.

Subject: LOGINN version 70.1 installed. 

The latest version of LOGINN has been put on SYS on all systems.  Version 70.1
plugs a security hole from creating a child frame and running LOGINN it in.
The old version of LOGINN did not detect this situation, and unconditionally
read the username from the command port.  Any unpriviliged user could attach
a PTY to the child frame, and send the characters "OPER<CR>" to it.  LOGINN
assumed that the characters came from TYMNET and that the Supervisor had 
verified the password already.  The new version uses the username that the
CREFRM uuo stored in GETTAB tables.

A description of the changes to LOGINN and LOGOUT are found in (OSU)LOGINN.INF
and (OSU)LOGOUT.INF on all systems.    /Joe

Version 21 outputs the name of the circuit when it is build and when it

out as BEEP instead of "^G" (so the bell from wrong OPER password comes
thru).  The switch character has been changed to ! since / and # are legal

Subject: Searching the PGY table does not flush cache. 

When the monitor wants to find whether a particular disk page is in core,
it does not make a linear search thru the PGY tables.  On a 4-meg system,
the last 12 bits of the disk address are used to index into an array
of heads of linked lists.  One of the PGY entries is the pointer to the
next core page that has the same disk hash.  The average linked list is
a chain of 2 or 3 entries.  After 4 or so compares, the monitor can decide
that the page is not in core, without flushing the cache.    /Joe

Subject: B39 crashes. 

System 39 has 2*MAPAL1, 3*EUE, 2*CHTFNF, 2*FILANF, FILAMO+FILAUU dumps.
I have not finished looking at all of them, but here's what I found so far.
MAPAL1 - DDB+DEVRIB has a bogus retrieval pointer, RBREAL (1B1) not on.
EUE - Part of the SETPRV uuo overwritten by an ATB.
EUE - PC matches P1 which is on top of stack, wild POPJ during DEVHNG.
EUE - Part of the CORE uuo overwritten by an FNB.
FILAMO+FILANF+FILAUU can all be caused by an ATB pointer not really pointing
to an ATB.
CHTFNF - Mapped page being unmapped, can't find core page number in CHT.

CRA008(EUE) and CRA009(MAPAL1) occured while running B39-P034/P-13.
Those two dumps look almost exactly like the EUE and MAPAL1 dumps from
running B39-P034/P37.

Maybe we should try expanding the amount of memory that can be used for
creating DDB/ATB/NMB/DRB blocks.  Running C55's monitor on B39 (which is
cut for 80 jobs instead of 127) will have a side effect of making more
core available for these blocks.

Problem:  Incrementing hard read errors, on one particular cylinder.  FSC
          checked the drive, OK, problem moved when pack was moved.
          They already copied out this pack once today, this new duplicate
          has its own set of bad spots.  Note: They were unable to copy the
          pack on F28, and did it on F40 (an IBM system) instead.
          FNDBAD reported 3 files with HRE.
Solution: Told them to rename the files to *.BAD and restore good copies from
          tape.  The files are now (NETSTAT)61014A.BAD, (SRA)PSPDAT.BAD, and
          (MSNTRACK)DUNS.BAD.  The file in NETSTAT is 10978 pages long.
Remark:   I will write a program tomorrow to free up all except the bad pages.



Need to find out why they could not copy the pack with PAKCOP.  They should
not have used an IBM to copy it - the problems they are having now are a
direct result of not having alternate tracks assigned on the destination pack.

Subject: Why PAKCP5 got hung while accessing unit 340. 

When there is something to do in the block multiplexor list, the SA10 sends
commands to the devices, one right after another.  The 3674 controller will
respond to the first one, and will reject all succeeding commands, saying
"I'm busy now".  PAKCOP sees the busy flag, and sets a bit for the unit saying
that it needs to be restarted when the control unit is available.  When the
3674 finishes that first command, it will cause an interrupt with the CU-END
bit set for for the first unit on the controller (disk unit 300).
PAKCOP checks to see if any other units on this controller got the BUSY status.
If so, those commands are put back into the block mux list and the SA10 is
restarted.  This works just fine for the first 32 disk units on the controller.

The problem is that the bits for units 340-377 are stored in a different word
than the bits for units 300-337.  When unit 340 is busy, it reports 340 busy,
but when the 3674 is available, it reports unit 300.  So PAKCOP got the CU-END
interrupt for 300, saw that 300-337 were not busy, and kept waiting for the
interrupt that said to restart I/O on units 340-337.

I patched the KONEND routine to check for waiting units on all controllers
when any CU-END was detected.  Voila - PAKCP5 saw all the units.

I'm still working on a solution to the contention problem.  I could format
units 300 and 301 together, 340+341, 300+341, and 301+340.  But attempting
to format units 300+340 or 301+341 caused "UNRECOVERABLE ERROR - LENGTH ERROR".

Subject: Names of the monitor, "/A" or not "/A". 

When I tried to create P035, I had a lot of hassles from MONED1.  It refused
to let me specify a monitor name without a slash.  Therefore I skipped ahead
to P035/A.  But then MONED got obstinate.  After much gnashing of teeth, new
SYSIDs were assigned and CNFNxx.MAC updated for all systems.  At that point,
I decided it wasn't worth playing games by MONED1's rules, and decided that
we really want P035 without "/A".

In OSP, the current CNFNxx.MAC files have been amended to say P035.  When
the people in distribution use "LOAD/SAVE:xx035 @MONxx", it will produce
P035 - this is the released monitor version.

However, if the CONFxx.MAC files need to be updated (increase jobs, more
disks, etc), then MONED1 must be run, and this will create P035/A.
Therefore, after the monitors have been distributed, (OSP) will produce
only P035/A.

The next monitor to be released after this one will be P035/B.

Problem:  System 25 had been down the previous evening with disk or
          controller problems.  Joe was expecting to use the system for
          testing but was unable to have access until after 10 PM.  They
          has some minor problems which Joe talked them through when the
          system was brought up.  This call was to find out how to delete
          some files DSKCLN had marked as bad.  The file names were all
          jumbled punctuation characters with a few letters thrown in.

Solution: I checked the ribs and the UFD data pages for errors and found
          everything intact.  Then I renamed all the files except the bad
          ones into OSNF and deleted *.* to remove the weird file names.
          I restored the files to BASELINE and told operations to restore
          from the all-files and incrementals anything that was lost.

Solution: Initially told operations that there should be no reason that
          they could NOT continue the restore at the beginning of the
          current tape.  Talked to Osman and found that the reason for
          the rebuild was that they were having problems since the head
          crash earlier this week.  I called operations back and told
          them that it would be better to restart the restore from tape
          one, to insure that everything was in order.

Subject: system 26 problems 

System 26 has had 2-3 bad sat stopcodes and 1 USRUS1 stopcode.  It was
related to me after not finding anything that they were doing an all-files
when each of these occurred.  ... They were on OPER at the time... all the
file sin OPER seem OK... the next directory is OSERANG with one file and
that is OK... the next directory is OSMAN and that seemed ok... I say
seemed, because after I did a directory of OSMAN and ran CKSUM on the first
and last few files  DIR (OSMAN)/UNSORTED  then we got the rib error and
then any lookup for files with the UFD in that directory failed...

The BAD SAT is on BPA3, page 10 ... with a likelyhood that one of the
system ufd pages reside there....

anyway, I told them to PAkCOPy the pack to another drive and see if
the problem goes away with a full dskcln, since the problem seems to
be intermittant... but mostly that drive.   I haven't entertained the
prospect of memory or controller beig bad, since everything else seems
to work fine...

Subject: Status of C26. 

I had them force a fast DSKCLN, then I logged in thru the MUX, SET OPR on one
job, and ran CKSUM on (OPER), (OSERANG), (OSMAN).  They ran TITO starting with
some directory in the N or O range.  The following came out on my OPR terminal:

?INFO stopcode "BADSAT" at 09-Nov-1986 20:11:12
C26, hardware ZZ, KL-1286, base 4200, C26-P034/P37, 9-30-86, M01778
   SAT IO: 000000   STT: 200153   STTFPC: 001133   SATCNT: 001132   SATBRD: 0
Requesting FULL DSKCLN
 ?
? BAD SAT ON BPA4 AT PAGE 10

!psp
DSKB:   103253
BPA4(DSKB7:260007):  SATFAIL:1

SATIO=0 means no read errors detected.  STT=200153 is the address of BPA4's
first SAT page.  STTFPC=1133 is the monitor's last known free page count for
this SAT.  SATCNT=1132 is current count of free pages.  SATBRD=0 means this is
the first reported bad read for any SAT.

SWAMP is complaining that SATCNT does not equal STTFPC.  This means that one
of the F or M bits got set to unavailable (zero) behind SWAMP's back.  Either
some routine marked one of the SAT bits and did not decrement STTFPC, or what
was read from the disk does not match what was in core when SWAMP/PCBIO
decided to swap the SAT page out.

This mangling of a bit in the SAT stored on page 10 has occurred on three
different units on C26 today, it occurred twice on C70 when it moved to 3650
disks, and it occurred twice on D34 when it moved to 3675 disks in Dallas.
That is, it does not appear to be a disk hardware problem, is not limited to
CPXKON, and could be a software or SA10 problem.  Adding the 1/2 meg of memory
to C26 may have aggravated the problem, I don't know.

I went into SYSTEM.SAV (26XP37) and boosted NMSTPC (Number of monitor SAT
PCB's) from 30 (2*15.) to 48 (DISKS*3).  This should cut down on the amount of
swapping of SAT pages.   /Joe

     PAKCP5.SAV is the new version which only works with the Memorex 
     3650 and 3652 disks which we have started to put on the PDP10's.

     Operationally, procedures of both program are the same as before.
     Only one command REFRESH, has been changed to ZFORMAT.

     If a 3650/3652 pack can not be ZFORMATed on the PDP10 because of
     a defective track, which must be done at least once when they are
     put on the PDP10 to work with TYMCOM-X operating system, defective
     track could be rewritten (fixed) under IBM/VM system using FIDS
     SA (Surface Analysis). This has been allready tested and proven to work.

     If there is any question feel free to give me a call at (415)794-2513
     or send mail to user name OSMAN on PDP10' or FSC.O/GUVEN on ONTYM.

Subject: BBOARD messages. 


Due to a limitiation in the TUMS mailing system, we cannot use the username
BBOARD.  TUMS assumes that we are trying to send mail to the UNIX BBOARD
system and snarfs up the mail...  sigh!

I've setup a mailbox for username INFO instead.  Untested as of this moment,
and this will only change if TUMS eats that mail also.  GRRRRRRR.

/Carl

Example:

   .SENDMA INFO
   Type letter:
   New LN03 printer is up on the micro-net.  To use the automatic spooling
   capability, simply copy the file you wish to have printed into directory
   (LPQ) on system 930 or 62.  At the moment no checking for binary files
   is performed, so please be careful what you copy into LPQ.

      Three formats are available for printing:

      Normal - Elite font, letter format, 60-61 lines by 88 characters
               all files not listed below are considered Normal

      Wide   - Compressed font, landscape format, 60-61 lines by 136 chars
               files with the extension .LSW are printed in this format

      8 LPI  - Compressed font, letter format, 80-82 lines by 100 chars
               files with the extension .LS8 are printed in this format

   If you wish normal printing of files with .LS8 and .LSW extensions, you
   must change the extension to something else (eg. .LST) when you copy it
   to (LPQ).   Please check to see if you are overwriting a file of the
   same name prior to copying your files to LPQ, otherwise someone else may
   take your printout.

Answer:   ASP dumps DSKB0, then DSKB1, etc.  It does not matter if DSKB0 has

Subject: Oper password file loses license when restoring from backup tape. 

16-Nov-86 18:15/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, Vijay, System 22.
Problem:  Could not set license after restoring from 14th's incremental.
Diagnosis: TITO complained about two files:
          (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO not given license WC
          (BOFANET)ONTYME.SAV not given license AC (SY,HF,RF,WF)
Fix:      Ran SETE then SETLIC on those two files.  System now up.
Note:     Carl and I have been discussing ways of giving license to TITO
          instead of to the operators.  We need to do something about it.

In this particular case, ASP restored all files with correct license.  Now if
TITO had all the license in the world, restoring files to SYS would not lose
license.  Giving license to TITO would be OK if
  1) TITO threw away license if not run by OPER.
  2) TITO threw away license if the TRANSLATE command was given.
  3) TITO kept license only for "RESTORE ALL" and the system number in the
     header matched the current system number.  (Operators would still need
     do set RF on their frame to do a STORE operation.)

This approach would not work if (SYS)TITO.SAV got wiped out and they had to
run TITO from tape.  Right now, only REFLAG gives the operator license when
running from tape.  We could make TITO use "SETE 777777,-1" to get all license
without having to take the system down, but it may be difficult to ensure that
only TITO gets to use it, and not some malicious program.

Or we could make it a restriction that if TITO gets wiped out, they have to
take the system down to get license from ONCE.  Then we could add a "TITO"
command to ONCE that takes device name as an argument (such as SYS: or FTA0:,
etc).  This command would tell ONCE to set CONSOLE-MANUAL mode, log in OPER
(without requiring ^Z L OPER), give the process all the license in the world,
then run TITO from the specified device.  This would avoid DDT and REFLAG and
give them a one-shot license for restoring files to SYS.  Once SYS was
restored and DSKCLN run, they could use the licensed copy of TITO on disk to
restore the rest of the files.

Any comments?

Subject: Restore answer... 

Yes, ASP restore is a structure restore... there not only must be the
same number of packs, they must all have an intact structure (built with
DEFINE and then REFRESH, or left from a previous set of system packs).

What is on those packs doesn't matter.  For example, a system 25 pack-set
could be used for a system 27 rebuild, as long as the system is brought
up as system 27 (change system number) in case ASP checks things like that
in the tape headers.

Subject: TITO license 

I'm still in favor of the  SETE 777777,-1  idea, although make it only work
via UUO from usrname OPER.  We put that into TITO so that it can setup its
license correctly, but only have it set the license if the given command is
STORE ALL and no translates have been enabled.

I also like the ONCE command TITO or REBUILD to come up in console mode.
This would set both REFLAG and the DOCTY flag to be used whenever a rebuild
operation is needed, either ASP or TITO...

I think we need to write up a document with the changes in it, so we can
hammer at the pros & cons of each situation.  We've discussed various parts
of various proposals on this topic many times, and each time, we overlook
a situation that we don't feel is important, which after some thought is
the main reason none of theses schemes has ever been implemented.

I'm creating (M33)OPRLIC.INF for this purpose.

Subject: B39 crashes. 

System 39 has 2*MAPAL1, 3*EUE, 2*CHTFNF, 2*FILANF, FILAMO+FILAUU dumps.
I have not finished looking at all of them, but here's what I found so far.
MAPAL1 - DDB+DEVRIB has a bogus retrieval pointer, RBREAL (1B1) not on.
EUE - Part of the SETPRV uuo overwritten by an ATB.
EUE - PC matches P1 which is on top of stack, wild POPJ during DEVHNG.
EUE - Part of the CORE uuo overwritten by an FNB.
FILAMO+FILANF+FILAUU can all be caused by an ATB pointer not really pointing
to an ATB.
CHTFNF - Mapped page being unmapped, can't find core page number in CHT.

CRA008(EUE) and CRA009(MAPAL1) occured while running B39-P034/P-13.
Those two dumps look almost exactly like the EUE and MAPAL1 dumps from
running B39-P034/P37.

Maybe we should try expanding the amount of memory that can be used for
creating DDB/ATB/NMB/DRB blocks.  Running C55's monitor on B39 (which is
cut for 80 jobs instead of 127) will have a side effect of making more
core available for these blocks.

22-Nov-86 17:44/Joe (Carl did not answer 3 beeps)
Contact:  Cupertino Operation (408)446-7705, David Jorgenson, System 26.
Problem:  Same as 9-Nov - System gets BADSAT when TITO all-files gets to

          RPG.SHR, then dies with something like USRUS1 stopcode.
Workaround: Whenever system gets BADSAT while TITO is doing the all files,
          let system stay up until either TITO gets error reading files or
          users get error reading files from SYS, then force a fast DSKCLN
          and tell TITO to resume starting after last complete directory saved.

Subject: BADSAT on system 26. 


Correction: DIdn't answer 1 beep. at 17:44

The previous 2 beebs, were at 6:10 am for system 26, re: BADSAT
  and 6:20 am for system 65, re: bad pack or bad drive causing read errors.

Fred called me back at 10ish this morning, re: more BADSAT problems and
stopcode EUE after the BADSAT occurred.

For system 26, I told Fred to take the system down and run a FAST DSKCLN
and to call me if the problem was not fixed.  Apparently the problem keeps
coming back while trying to do an all-files with TITO.  It had problems
with directories CARL and CNFE this morning.

After the DSKCLN, I told them to continue with the all-files where it left.
Apparently, Joe told them the same for the third call today.  No other
indications were found.


For system 65, I restored SYSTAT and DSKCLN from another system and PSP
indicated a bad drive/pack, so I told them to call TM to look at the drive,
if TM says ok, to try it again, or if it fails, PAKCOP the bad pack and
go from there...  after TM is finished.

PS:  THanks Joe, for catching the 17:44 call.  I was out shopping and

Subject: Hotline calls - busy weekend 

(...and it's only saturday night!)

22-Nov-86 19:20 /Carl
Contact:  Fremont Operations via answering service, Bonnie, System F58.
Problem:  System crashed 5 times during previous 8 hours plus a few in
          the morning: 7:48 BADSAT, 11:21 THUNG on all drives + BADSAT
          on unit 2, 15:03 FILAUS stopcode, 17:37 SEAR14 stopcode, 17:44
          FILAUS stopcode.   ... (additional crashes, but times not
          recorded by me, operations has the times)...  more SEAR14 and
          FILAUS stopcodes.

          All files save in progress, incremental backup save in progress
          and the last crash, both incremental and all-files in progress.

          Last files to tape foreach were: (NETSTAT)61119B.DMI, 61105A.DMS
          and 61114C.DMS.  These files were ok.  Files recorded in the
          NETSTAT directory just before and after each of these appeared
          to be ok except 61113B.DMS which caused the system to crash with
          FILAUS during my examination.  I renamed it to (CRASH) and set
          NDL and NFS bits.  TThe NETSTAT directory has 470,000+ pages in
          500+ files, many of the DMS and DMI files are 5000 to 10000 pages
          each.  (CKSUM takes a long time!!!)   I mention this, because we
          are badly in need of a utility program which reads the ribs of
          all files, or all files in a directory, looking for bad pointers.
          DSKCLN is supposed to do this, and fix them (or mark them bad)
          and apparently it doesn't!

Plan:     I've told operations to restore the file and continue with both
          the incremental backup and the all files, and to call me if they
          crash with FILAUS.

          I told Bonnie to have operations call us every time they get the
          FILAUS stopcode, so that we can locate the bad file immediately.
          If they get a BADSAT error, or BADSAT crash, that they should
          (on an error, not a crash) continue running until TITO complains
          about reading files (or until they cannot access system files)
          and then to recycle and force a fast DSKCLN.  I told her that we
          need NOT be called for each BADSAT... Sending mail is enough until
          further notice.  We are aware of the problem and are working on a
          fix.

(it's been a long weekend) sigh.

Subject: Hotline calls 

** Turnover to Osman - in case you get calls **

Mostly system 26 and 58.  Same problems BADSAT (26 & 58) and FILAUS (58).
For the bad sat, operations has pretty much been told to proceed until they
have problems accessing system files such as RPG, LOGINN or LOGOUT.  For
FILAUS, they have been told to call us immediately, so that we may look at
the crash and the corresponding backup or all-files tape (TITO) to see what
file caused the crash.

26 had a few problems with BADSAT during the all-files, and they reloaded to
run a fast DSKCLN (forced over FULL) to clear the problem.

System 58 had me on the phone off and on all day with FILAUS and BADSAT trying
to do the daily backup and the all-files.  Username NETSTAT which has over
450,000 pages in 500+ files, many of which are 5k-10k pages in size, had many
bad files which caused FILAUS.  Some were fixed by the DSKCLN which ran, others
have been renamed to (CRASH) with NDL and NFS set.

As of this message, the all-files finished and they were working on the daily
backup, in directory NETSTAT.  I hope yopu don't have any calls...  /Carl

Subject: PRPRPL versions and installations 

Newest versions of XEXEC %1(174) and EXECX %1(200) have been distributed
to most systems, (but not all--due to hosts down).  I've installed them
on SYS on 22 but didn't start it since that system seems to be fine...
I've installed them on SYS on 34 and 54 and started them running.  They
appear to be working fine with the restarting scheme we discussed on
Friday.
It's running on 930 and 62 as well.  EXECX is started whenever necessary
and logs itself out after 15 minutes if there is no work to do.

Dennis & Osman, I'd appreciate it if you can make sure this version gets
installed everywhere.  XEXEC %1(174) has DDT loaded to trace the ill-mem-ref
bug (which hasn't occurred since we loaded DDT, sigh).

Subject: FILAMO investigation 


FILAMO on system 34 (6), 22 (1), 54 (1) and 23 (1) are all identical.
It appears to be very reproduceable, albeit not on command.

Symptoms appear to be the system crashing due to decrementing the maximum
write count for an ATB with a zero count (causing an overflow to -1).
The running job is XEXEC in each case, executing the exact same instruction:

  FRMOP 1,BLOCK    where 1/ 23,,child-job  and block contains 7.


XEXEC is in fact reading the HALT STATUS BLOCK of a job which it received
an exit-in-child or logout-in-child interrupt, which appears to be gone
by the time the system crashes, although the FRMOP doesn't complete.  It
appears that the .FOHSB function 23 may have an interaction problem with
jobs in the process of logging out.  The job in question has been MAILER
running in username MAIL.  The only discrepancy I found was that the job
state fo the target frame said NULQ, and the queue table said STOPQ.

-----------------------

FILAMO, FILANF on system 39 appear to be caused by a different problem.
In both cases (3 saved crashes) the value of SYSCOR = 0, instead of having
a link-pointer address,,0.  This indicates that we are running out of
file-service free core blocks.   SImply raising the amount may solve the
problem, but I thought that there was an interlock to wait for free-core
CB wait may do it... FC is the otehr free-core.

I will continue to look into this...  it should not die due to running out.
Unless... all dormant blocks are reused, and there seems to be a good list
of dormant atb/drb blocks.

/Carl


We may want to put in an info stopcode which warns of frecore low?

Subject: Locating the sources to system programs using FINDIT.TEC 

If you are looking for the sources to a particular program, you can often save
yourself some trouble by checking if the information is already on-line, on
system 930 in the files (JMS)*.WHR.  These WHR files are created when I try
to find where the sources are.          /Joe Smith, 26-Nov-86

How to use FINDIT.TEC

A) Make sure that you have (SYS) in your DO list after (XEXEC).
   See (JMS)RPGINI.CTL for an example on how to do this.

B) Copy (JMS)FINDIT.TEC to your directory.

The above two steps need to be done only once.

C) Have MHX run FINDIT on all systems, creating a .WHR file.

D) Mung the WHR file using FINDIT.TEC to clean up the file and add host numbers.

E) Optionally sort the WHR file if you want to.

Example of step C - running FINDIT via MHX

01	.MHX
02	hosts: 10S
03	commands (end with ctrl-D):
04	O$
05	FINDIT
06	TELEC#.*,AUXMO#.*
07	
08	SYSNO
09	record? Y
10	output file: TELECO.WHR
11	detach? Y

01 Start (MPL)MHX.
02 Tell MHX to go to all PDP-10 systems (as defined in JOBS.DAT).
03 Prompt from MHX.
04 Type "O", ESCape, and your OPER password.  Note that MHX turns off echo
   while it is reading the password.
05 Run (SPL)FINDIT on each system
06 Tell FINDIT to look for TELECO.SAV, TELECF.223, and AUXMOX.SAV.
   TELECF.223 is the FDM file for version 22.3, therefore when searching for
   sources and FDM files, it is a good idea to have # as 6th char of filename.
07 Blank line is required to get out of FINDIT.
08 Dummy line, I put it in out of habit
09 Control-D to end commands, MHX asks if you want to record output in a file.
10 My convention is to use *.WHR to keep lists of where files are.
11 Detach.  You can monitor MHX's progress from another terminal.  MHX changes
   its name (as reported by SYSTAT) to be "MHX:nn" when going to host nn.

Example of step D - MUNGing the file
In this example I use a different WHR file and show only the significant lines.

12	.DIR KLKS.WHR
13	KLKS    WHR      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
14	.MUNG FINDIT,KLKS.WHR
15	FINDIT V2 - Fix output from FINDIT by putting username after file name
16	29:
17	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:29)          15  07-Dec-78  14:49  ALL  RD  NO
18	62:
19	ACCESS.MSG  (KS2020:62)         2  24-Feb-81  14:45  ALL  RD  NO
20	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:62)          12  09-Jul-80  20:25  ALL  RD  NO
21	"Done

12-13 The log file does not show up until MHX is done.
14 The MUNG command runs (SYS)MUNG.SAV which runs (JMS)TECO.SHR.  The first
   argument is the name of the commands file (FINDIT.TEC), the argument after
   the comma is the name of the file that FINDIT.TEC is to work on.
15 FINDIT.TEC identifies itself.
16+18  Each host number is typed as it is found.
17,19-20 Note that username and host have been moved to the middle of the
   record.  The filename is now in column 1 where it can be sorted.  Every
   line of the file is typed out, you can use Control-O to suppress it.
21 FINDIT.TEC is done.

Example of step E - SORTing the file

22	.DIR KLKS.*
23	KLKS    WHR      25  26-NOV-86 1552    ALL RD  NO     12044
24	KLKS    BAK      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
25	.SORT KLKS.WHR=KLKS.WHR
26	SORTED 774 RECORDS

22-24 The BAK file can be deleted.  It is created in case you run FINDIT.TEC
  on a WHR file that has already been MUNGed once.
25 (XEXEC)SORT takes OUTPUT.FIL=INPUT.FIL, sorts in ascending order, using
   the entire line as a key.
26 SORT is done.
27 I sometimes massage the sorted WHR file by replacing "(SYS:22)" with
   "(SYS:*)" and deleting the redundant lines that say that XXX.SAV was
   installed on all systems on the same day.

Subject: 3652's working as 3650's, but problems with 3650's. 

Status of 3652 project as of Wednesday afternoon:

I have a monitor that works with a string of 3652 disks, treating it as if
it were two strings of 3650 disks.  That is, the problems caused by the
differences between the 3652 and 3650 model disks have been taken care of.

But when I try to build a two-pack system from TITO all-files, I am still
having problems.  These problems are the same as the ones we are experiencing
on the other systems that have the new SA10 and 3650 disks, systems 26, 58,
and 70.  We plan to have a new KL in Fremont hooked up over this weekend.
Anything we discover here in Fremont on this new system will be directly
applicable to the 3652 systems.  Therefore, as soon as we get the 3650
monitor working right, this will be the 3652 monitor as well.

Osman and I will look at the problem over the weekend, and will let you know.

Subject: XEXEC and MAILER 

The FILAMO crashes seem to be on the rise... systems 70 and 55 each
caught one today sometime after my newest XEXEC %1(200) was installed.

Since it's apparent that the problem is aggravated by XEXEC doing the
frmop to look at the halt-status-block of the MAILER job as the mailer
is logging out, and this reliably crashes system 34 when MAILER runs,
I have removed MAILER from the queue on ALL, repeat ** ALL ** systems.

(Well, most.  It is still running on X62, X95 and X930!)

I will see if I can put a work-around into XEXEC early next week, and
put MAILER back into the queue.

--------------
Note:  MAILER is still being run, each time someone wants to send mail
about the batch job being run, so (bill?) if this is enough to take care
of the queued mail files (MAIL)*.Q let me know, and I'll leave mailer
out of the queue (since it's being run every so often anyway).

ESCape for $).  That will show the last 2560 characters that have been
typed on the CTY, plus parts of the Control Block for APA0, since $0T
stops all the first null (ASCIZ).  By the way, the "CB"+Linefeed that

"STORE G3 CREATED AFTER 0:00 1-NOV-86", and it store all the files in

Subject: Located a bug in DECRMV(FILAMO). 

I believe I have found the cause of the FILAMO crashes at DECRMV+13.

Before
	PUSHJ	P,GETATB	;! GET ATB ADDRESS IN T1
	MOVE	P2,T1		;! SAVE IT IN P2 FOR LATER
	PUSHJ	P,GETCBR	;! GET CB, DIDDLING WITH ATBS
	TLZN	P3,LMPMXW	;%! MAX WRITE ON FOR THIS SLOT?

After
	PUSHJ	P,GETCBR	;! Get CB now so ATB won't disappear
	PUSHJ	P,GETATB	;%! GET ATB ADDRESS IN T1
	MOVE	P2,T1		;%! SAVE IT IN P2 FOR LATER
	TLZN	P3,LMPMXW	;%! MAX WRITE ON FOR THIS SLOT?

In the BEFORE code, if the monitor reschedules between GETATB and GETCBR,
then the other job could come in, GETCBR, and delete the ATB.  When the
original job is allowed to run again, T1 and/or P2 would point to a
nonexistant ATB.  Or, if the original job was really delayed, then T1/P2
would point to somebody else's newly created ATB and prematurely release it.
Even worse, if a new DRB or NMB was allocated where the old ATB was, the
wrong fields would get modified, mangling the in-core database.

Subject: FILAUS may be caused by whatever causes BADSAT. 

An SPT entry is made whenever two jobs map in the same page of the same file.
When the routine that sets the M bit (because the page is now mapped into
core) finds the M bit already set and no SPT entry exists, it then creates
an SPT entry.

If an M bit is erroneously set in the SAT, then an unexpected SPT entry will
be created.  When the last legitimate mapper of the file is done with the
page, the use count is decremented.  FILAUS is detected whenever the use
count goes to zero and an unexpected SPT entry exists.

SPTs should never be created when the system is up MANUAL.  I believe the
FILAUS problem on 24 is reproducible even when MANUAL.  If so, setting a
breakpoint at CRESPT should point to the culprit.  I will test this Monday.

Subject: New program: (SPL)CPY %1 


Currently in distribution is CPY version %1 which replaces ms rhe
functionality of the (SPL)COPY program in a slightly modernized form.
This new program uses the ARGS/ARGPAR command-line scanning package and
may be run via special command mode as a pseudo monitor command.  Type
"CPY ?" for a list of switches and normal command usage.

This program may also be run from the job processor by passing the command
line in the PARAMETERS option in SUBMIT.   This was the main reason for
the release of this program.  A use      w run a periodic job which will
run (SPL)CPY.SAV as an automatic distribution mechanism.  Using the new
/UPDATE switch file data which hasn't changed will not be re-transferred.
However, there is one drawback that TELECO-AUXMOX has and that is the
protection on the destination file will be reset to ALL RD NO each time
a copy is attempted even though no data is transferred.

An example run:
    !CPY ACCESS.MSG,SUBMIT.SAV/HOSTLIST:38/SUPERSEDE
    username [S      <cr>
    [logging in as SUBMIT]
    Hosts: 38
    [Telecopy in frame 8]

    !TYPE 008TEL.COM
    REPLACE
    NO UPDATE
    ONLC
    (SUBMIT:62)ACCESS.MSG,(SUBMIT:38)ACCESS.MSG
    (SUBMIT:62)SUBMIT.SAV,(SUBMIT:38)SUBMIT.SAV
    QUIT


Note:  multiple hosts may be specified separated by commas, * and 10s
       are accepted to mean all-hosts (or if /CENTER is specified, all
       hosts in the same data center as the host you are currently on).

Documentation is forthcoming... someday.

Subject: .IANIC Notice-in-child 

Comments please...

1)  Add new parent-child interrupt .iaNIC to cause an interrupt in the
    parent frame whenever anyone attempts to evict the child frame.  The
    child will remain unscathed until the parent issues an evict uuo to
    the child.  This new interrupt cause is similar to Exit-in-child and
    is set by the parent frame.

2)  Change the monitor to check for the new trap before issuing NTQ to a
    frame and if set and the calling frame is NOT the parent, issue the
    new interrupt to the parent, otherwise perform the current checks and
    the current actions.

3)  Add flag bits to the evict uuo to (1) "ignore" the new interrupt and
    perform as it does now (returning any .iaNTQ channel if enabled) and
    (2) only check for any .iaNIC channel that may be enabled.  The older
    programs which do not set the new flag bits will return the channel
    number associated with either .iaNIC or .iaNTQ if set, so that the
    desired functionality may be achieved.

    The evicting program really need not know, but it mght be nice
    for specialty programs which wonder WHY they cannot kill a job!

    TAKEIT could use the old way the first time, and if no response set
    this new bit, and if still no response kill it as it does now.

    ================================================================

By providing this mechanism, we no longer need to know if a particular frame
is considered a "batch" frame or not.  If the interrupt is enabled, it is a
batch frame, or there is a knowledgeable parent around to take care of the
child.  "Any" child frame could be considered "batch".

Subject: Why nothing ever appeared in the BAT pages. 

I found out why the monitor never wrote anything in the BAT pages when
it found a page with an I/O error.  The routine UPERBT in CORE1 read in the
BAT pages, but would not update them if they failed the consistancy check.
Since ONCDSK/REFSTR never set the self pointers, the consistency check always
failed.  I fixed this by changine POPJ P, to PJRST WTBOTH at CHKBAT+5.
"BAMPHF!" BAT pages now work!.  I ran CKSUM on the 11 bad files in BADFILES,
and we now have 11 known bad spots marked in the BAT pages.

Now if DSKCLN honors the BAT pages, and sets the F bit for them even if they
are not part of a file, then we won't need to keep the RIBs around anymore.

Symptom:  FILAUS during All-Files.  Directory (NETDATA).  Both tape directory
          and CRA014 report the bad file as (NETDATA)MCRF.OCT whcih crashed
          the system when I deleted it.

Solution: Had operations do a FAST DSKCLN and restore the file from backup.
          Since C70 is still running /P37 we still need to be involved in
          verifying what the bad file was/is.  I told Barbara that they can
          do a directory of the tape and if a CKSUM of the last file on tape
          crashes the system, to delete the file, run a fast DSKCLN, restore
          the file and continue (without calling us).  If the CKSUM does not
          crash the system, call us so we can find the bad file.

Joe?  Can we put up a newer monitor which prints out the filename on FILAUS
      so operations can always find the bad file without wasting time...

Subject: DSKCLN looks at BAT pages. 

The current version of DSKCLN does correctly process the BAT pages.
However, the version of PAKCOP on M33 and the old version on SYS do not.
Only PAKCP5/PAKCP3 interpret the numbers in the BATs as being page numbers
like they should.  PAKCOP reads the page numbers and thinks they are block
numbers.  This means that known bad spots on the disk will be reported and
require manual intervention instead of being bypassed automatically during
a COPY operation.  No big deal.

Problem:  System had THUNG errors earlier and related disk problems, so
          FSC had the system to check things out.  When FSC gave the
          system back, they left some of the spare drives powerd up and
          on-line.  They told operatios that they didn't change anything
          so operations started to bring the system up.

          This resulted in missing or inconsistant pack-set id on one
          or more of the spare drives.  BPA7 was formatted a DSKB0, so we
          had two dskb0's, system wanted to know if they wanted to init
          the BAT pages, etc.

Solution: I had them stop the machine, bring it to boots... check the CTY
          output for the previous "good" load of the system, and verify
          which packs should be spinning and which ones should be off-line.
          After that, I had them follow the procedure for missing/inconsist-
          ant pack-set id (i walked them through DDT).  System came up and
          is running a FULL DSKCLN at this very moment.

Subject: Significant change to EXEC commands 

Due to the overwhelming cry for monitor commands that do not
conflict with job processor EXEC commands the following is
now true in EXECX %1(216) and later:

:command   is ALWAYS a command to the job processor
.command   is ALWAYS a command to the operating system
*line      is unchanged (program data)
=line      is unchanged (program data)~r

For TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 command files, a pseudo mode is used to
designate commands which works like the old EXECX, with the one
difference that in TOPS10 mode, "." is the command prefix char
and in TOPS20 mode, "@" is the command prefix characer.  In both
of these modes, :command is illegal and ::label does not work!

in %1(217) and later, the pre-declared keyword $Format contains
the string "TYMCOMX", "TOPS10" or "TOPS20" and may be set by the
user.  in some future version of SUBMIT the FORMAT option will
allow users to submit jobs in each of the available formats.

/Carl                The documentation should be updated and shipped
                     at the same time %1(216) or later is distributed.

The bug you mentioned about SUBMIT stopping on the first canceled entry is
much more serious than you had let on.  I had two entries in the queue, canceled
the first one, then tried "LIST".  SUBMIT was stuck in an infinite loop with
Control-C being trapped!  TURN OFF THE *#$%&# CONTROL-C TRAP!!!!!  If you
must have it, enable ONLY during the critical code and disable IMMEDIATELY
afterward!
  Operations is not going to like see naive users running a job that
chews up all the CPU cycles and cannot be killed.

Subject: F3TSER bug. 

It usually takes 11 tapes to backup 930 and 7 to backup 62.  Did you know it
is possible to save all of 930's files on 2 tapes?  It is very simple.  All
you have to do is mount the second tape without a write-ring.  When you tell
TITO to continue, it appears to save the rest of DSKB but the tape does not
move.  That is, whenever you do a write operation to a write-locked tape on
the F3, F3TSER does not catch the error.  The tape controller refuses to write
to a write-locked tape, and tells F3TSER about the illegal command, but F3TSER
ignores the error, lies to the operating system by saying that the write
request succeeded, and all that wonderful data drops into the bit bucket.

In other news, I was unable to do an all-files on 930 on Friday because the
tape keeps losing vacuum.  Capik has been notified.    /Joe

Carl and I discovered that if you read a record that is more than 15 pages
long on an F3, then some poor user's UPT gets wiped out.  The unfortunate
job either can't run anything at all, or every command typed will do a
CONTINUE on the current core image.  Anyway, he tried to read 24 pages with
ASP, and that mangled my context pages to the point that everything I typed
threw me back into SED.

Subject: FILAUS alias DECUMC+10 

I want to bring up the fact that FILAUS is 'not' a new problem... we may
very well have introduced something else to cause FILAUS or maybe fixed
something else which used to die sooner (never reaching the FILAUS check).
We don't really know.  Our suspicion is that we've introduced something
because we have been seeing more and more of them.

Osman has been backing up crashes for a few years now... it might be well
worth our while to look at some of the old crashes to see if they were
caused by holes in the files.  Does anyone think this tact is worthwhile?

Can we look at the ATB/SPT that is being decremented and figure out which
page in the file we are looking at when the crash occurrs and verify that
there is a hole in the file?

Can we verify that the block we are decrementing is current and not just
old garbage because a pointer didn't get updated?

Can we verify that we don't have multiple pointers for different users or
files pointing to the same blocks, thus one (current) gets updated but the
other (pointing at what it thinks is something else) doesn't?

This doesn't seem to be the same problem we've seen where we get a mixedup
SAT page? or can it be?  ... do the SAT bits get cleared before or after a
DECUMC call?  If indeed we have 1 user and we think we have 2, we should in
some other case have two users and think we have 1, thus the SAT bit gets
deallocated and possibly reused before the 2nd user is done...  that is a
frightening thought!

Subject: DSKCLN actions, BDA 

Re: BDA bit
    My viewpoint on BDA is that we should make it stand for what we have
thought it meant.  This file has been found bad by the damage assement
program, DSKCLN.  At present it means the entire file has been eliminated.
I believe that it is reasonable to use BDA to mean DSKCLN has found anything
wrong with the file.
    This includes bad rib pointers, hard read of a rib page, multiply used
pages, and even bad allocation (although it is possible to have RIBALP set
to a different value than RIBSIZ+<ribs> specifies.  RIBALP specifies the
allocated file size including holes.)
    Things such as wrong UFD time and ufd quota fixups can continue to be
'invisible' to users, since these are expected to be fixed the next time
the user logs in or dskcln runs.

Re: DSKCLN for release...
    To attain our goal of 3650 block mode within a secure environment, we
should modify DSKCLN to put all files which it finds bad, (that is any that
we feel BDA should be set), into RECOV.SYS and print them out on the CTY
as well.  Exactly what happens to multiply used ribs or ribs with hard read
errors is open to discussion.  The main problem with ribs that have hard
read errors is that DSKCLN will mark as FREE any pages in the unreadable rib
and when the rib becomes readable, those pages will be multiply used.
    For multiply used pages, we could give the page to the most recently
created file (if that information were available... it isn't since a newer
creation date is only a data field with a higher number stored in it, not
a real internal creation date).  Otherwise our only solution is to mark it
bad and not to let anyone access that page until all pointers to that page
have been deleted.

I ran newest DSKCLN in checking mode to re-generate a list of files

System 22 just keeps crashing... something is dreadfully wrong.
To eliminate the DSKCLN as a cause, I put the OLD version which is

Subject: The new PDP-10 bases need to be validated. 

Whenever new hardware is assigned to be used as a PDP-10 system, we in TXS
need to be notified as early as possible to modify the configuration files,
and Validations need to be notified so that the new base can be added to the
class of PDP-10 bases.  Failure to do this can cause problems for any of our
customers that need to build aux circuits.

I noticed this problem when I tried to build a circuit to CUD10:930 from the
new KL in Solar Way.  Its base, node 10350, was not in the group and class
list that CUD10 is valid for.

There was not much of a problem when C70 moved from Cup-A to Cup-C since it is
the backup for the private nets and is not used much.  But I see the potential
for severe problems when C22 is moved to the hardware with a new base node.

If what I fear is true, then all of the private net users can log in to F22,
but none of them can build circuits out.  They will not be able to get LOADII
or NAD to build a circuit to their private nodes.  And since C70 is running on
a relatively new base, it is possible they won't be able to C70 either.

Subject: C22 F22 Information 

Joe, Osman,...
   To add to the morass of confusion...  for what appeared to be no reason
at all, system 22's accounting device was released at 3:20am and the system
went to BOOTS.  Fremont OPS forced a FULL DSKCLN at 3:35 and attempted to
bring the system back up.

   Apparently, CUPC OPS must have take the system down, because around that
time they were starting to do the ASP rebuild of system 22 in CUPC and the
operator forgot about F22 (and since the packs say the same thing, C22 at
the moment there must have been some confusion).   Anyway, CUPC OPS forgot
to do a CHANGE SYS and came up as C22 (after taking F22 down!) and began the
ASP restore.  C22 is on hardware AA base node 2100!

    F-22 finished full DSKCLN sometime between 4:15ish and 4:45ish when OPS
called the hotline because they couldn't login to F22 even though the CTY
said that DSKCLN was completed.  They complained that it told them it was
shut.  (I believe that this information came from probe).

    I tried to login to 22 and got what appeared to be a super-shut system.
OPS reassured me that DSKCLN sait it was done and initialization completed.
I asked OPS to tell me more of what happened.  I went in with probe to check
on 22 and it said SHUT and up on node 2100.  I asked OPS what node F22 was
on and they said 3374.  Hmmmm!  I asked them to check and the base itself
was flashing 3374 they told me.

  I logged in to 930 and printed the conf file and it said 3374, but very
nicely (thank you joe or osman) commented out was hardware 'AA' node 2100!
I then explainded that I thought 22 must have been brought up in CUPC.  I
called BLDG-C OPS and Tom told me they were doing an ASP restore and they
were on the third tape.  I had him check, and apparently the operator had
forgotten to do a CHANGE SYS.  >>ARRRRGH<<<  Tom said he'd have them stop
the ASP and start over after bringing the system back up with a CHANGE SYS.

  I called fremont OPS back and told Lynn that my suspicions were correct.
OPS in CUPC had come up on the net with C22 and that was why F22 went away.
I suspect that CUPC logged in to F22, saw that it said C22 and took it
down... that explains why F22 went down without Fremont OPS knowing about
it, and C22 up on the net SHUT explains why F22 would not come into the
network answered.

  F22 came back up at 5:12 and ran a FAST DSKCLN and was up answered by
5:20 am.  C22 is up as "12 SHUT 0 IIX-N EBUS SLOT# 1" and all is well in
the world.

  (except that I've lost another hour of sleep and both my wife and I
   were awakened unnecessarily.. sigh)

The following three Ontymes from RPM indicates the NODES that are to
be transferred/brought up in Fremont along with the Host Numbers.

To prevent having the same fiasco that happened with system 22 when it came
up in Fremont, it is requested that the appropriate departments take whatever
action is neccessay to insure these nodes are set up correctly, i e. in
the correct GROUP TABLE and MAGNUM Data bases.

For your information System 33 will be coming up on NODE 2333 the weekend
of 30 January 1987.  It is presently on NODE 6415.

Users on these systems must be able to build aux circuits to and from these
Systems.

The two new NODES in Fremont ND 3374 and ND 10350 are here.  If Vialidations

Subject: DSKCLN version 36J(102) works. 

The results are in (SYS)RECOV.SYS and readable by CTYLOG.
The only difference between 36J(101) and 36J(102) is that the latter outputs
"Multiply used pages - starting pass 2" and "SATs written to disk", even when
in fix mode.  (I wanted it to be obvious why DSKCLN was taking twice as long as
usual.)

Because SPAGES was bad on C26, DSKCLN always found multiply used pages, and
always did pass 2.  That's why DSKCLN took twice as long on C26 than the
other systems.

It will look very impressive when we tell them that the new version of DSKCLN
will eliminate the FILAUS problem and run twice as fast as the old one.
It will be impressive after the existing bad files are eliminated.

Joe,
  I have some interesting results to bring up.  I've only
seen the results on one system (26) so far but,
I am confident that a repeat of the
run will produce similar results.  If
this is rtrue, then we have a fix on waht
is happenning with ASP, and why it doesn't work.

Systems F22, D23, C26, C29, F30, C33, B36, F38, B39, F58, F70 and F74
have all been patched in teh running monitor, SYSTEM.SAV and NEWMON.SAV
to reflect the change to MAPUS4+22/ CAMGE M,UNIPPU(U) instead of CAMG...

This fixes an OLD off by one bug when doing super-map i/o to any flavor
disks when a single map request split across two units.  This fix should
make ASP more reliable and we should no longer see any bad files after
an ASP restore (unless the files were already damaged before the SAVE).

Date: JANUARY 28,1987 0:49
Whenever you do a PSP on system 58, you will find that SYSTAT does not know
how to decode SLBN and HLBN on 3650 disks.  In particular, the hard read error
on DSKB11(BPA13) is at 200022,,000511 octal.  For a 3330, that page number is
CYL:3 HEAD:16 RECORD:10, but since 58 is running on 3650 disks, the bad spot is
really on CYL:1 HEAD:22 RECORD:18.  That corresponds to the HRE found in
(SYS)SPAGES.SYS, which can safely be ignored.   /Joe

Subject: Problem with ASP located and fixed. 

Every ASP tape created before 28-Jan-87 is missing data.  For every three
disks saved to tape, two pages were missing.  They are page 5 on disk 3n+1
and page 15 of disk 3n+2.  These were not picked up due to a long standing
bug in MAPIO that handles the CHANIO function to super-map disk pages.

The missing pages on disk 3n+1 caused no trouble, since it is the third
page of BOOTS, which was never used (BOOTS is actually 1.75 pages long), and
was re-written by running BOOTS.KI or BOOTS.KL.

The octal addresses of the other missing pages were page 17 on unit 2, page 17
on unit 5, page 17 on unit 10, page 17 on unit 13, page 17 on unit 16.  For
systems with 3 strings, page 17 on unit 21 and page 17 on unit 24 would also
be missing.  This means that after doing an ASP restore on a 14-pack system,
4 files would lose one page of data each.  If the page wasn't a RIB, there
would be no indication.  Instead of a page of data, the file would have a
page full of zeros that the formatter (PAKCOP) had written and ASP hadn't.

How the problem occurred:

When ASP read from the disk, it would do so by super-mapping a range of 24
pages.  When it got to the end of DSKB0, the request of 24 pages would
encompass the last 16 pages of DSKB0 and the first 6 pages of DSKB1.  Due to
the bug in MAPIO, the first 16 pages in the range would be mapped correctly,
but the 17th would get mapped to the first page on cylinder 808 (which is not
allowed) and the 18th thru 24th would get mapped to pages 0 thru 4 on DSKB1
(instead of 0 thru 5).  The next group of 24 pages would get mapped to pages
6 thru 31 on DSKB1, which means that page 5 of DSKB1 never got read from the
disk.  On restore, the same bug meant that page 5 of DSKB1 never got written
back to the disk.

As mentioned earlier, missing page 5 is no big deal.  However, page 15 (octal
17) was most likely part of someone's file.  No pages were missing from DSKB0,
DSKB3, DSKB6, etc since 3*68680 is evenly divisible by 24.

For 3650 disks formatted in pages (C26, C70, and F58's old disks), the pattern
repeated evry 4 disks.  Disk 4n+0 lost nothing, 4n+1 lost page 17 (octal 21),
4n+2 lost page 11 (octal 13), and 4n+3 lost page 5 (BOOTS again).  Page 13
on DSKB2 was part of [1,4].UFD, losing meant losing 102 files from SYS.

This bug has existed ever since P033 (when TYMCOM-X converted to pages) and
is now fixed.  The DSKCLN bug has also existed for the same period of time.
Since P033 came out in the summer of 1977, these are "ten-year bugs".

Subject: ASP saves and rebuilds 

We have a "small" problem with ASP rebuilds.  I called Fremont ops to
determine if operations records what monitor was used to take the ASP
dumps.  The answer is, they don't... however, at the beginning of each
shift, they log what monitor is up on each system, so by extrapolation
it can be determined what monitor was "known" to be running.

Re:  What happens if an ASP dump is taken with ???-P034/P37 and they
     attempt to do the restore using ???-P034/P37-1 where -1 is the new
     patch MAPSUP.PAT fixing the off by 1 supermap.

What happens is that on selected units, the first n pages (where n is
determined using the formula that Joe mentioned in his last message on
this topic) are shifted on the disk by 1 page.

This means that the system won't come up, because most likely one or both
of the HOM pages are in the wrong places and the disk looks scrambled!

(This also means that Osman should NOT use the new monitor to restore any
 old ASP tapes on the test systems... otherwise we will think something
 new is broken, until we realize what happenned!)

I called Fremont and CUPC ops and told them that they need to contact
software support BEFORE doing any ASP rebuilds for the next few weeks
so that we can determine which monitor they should use to do the rebuild.

Tomorrow, we can talk to Rick Daniels and get it squared away for all of
the data centers.  I also think that we need to have operations log what
monitor is used in all future TITO and ASP saves and restores so that any
problems caused by monitor or program changes can be detected.
(That also means logging TITO and ASP version numbers)

When I patched CUPC and FREMONT hosts earlier this week, I did not patch
the monitor version number, so if a rebuild is necessary we need to get
the time and date to match against when the systems were patched. PATLOG
exists on most of the systems.

Osman, have all of the Dallas machines been patched?  We ought to collect
a list of times for each system... I will start such a list in the file
(m33:930)SYSPAT.INF for just such a purpose.

Subject: Non-optimal page allocation still in P035/B. 

1-Feb-87 at 14:56 - changed GETAP0+2 in SWAMP from MOVEI T3,1 to MOVEI T3,0.
This change to the running monitor was to make C26's files more equally
distributed on X32's disks in Fremont.

Before the patch is the column labeled "one".  At the instant I ran SYSTAT,
SWAMP was picking on BPA12 only.  After the patch, column "three" shows pages
being allocated from BPA13+BPA14+BPA15.  Once the free space on those three
packs matched that on BPA12, then it was also used (column "four").  As soon as
BPA11 thru BPA15 got down to 76648 pages each, then new pages were allocated
equally on all 12 packs.  The column marked "all" was at 15:30.

	linked list of files that need fixing, it runs out of core.  The
	program CLRALC turns off this bit on all files so DSKCLN can run.

Bug in DSKCLN:	If there is garbage in the UFD, then CLRALC causes the monitor
	to crash when it attempts to LOOKUP that garbage.  CLRALC can't run
	until DSKCLN fixes the disk, DSKCLN can't run until CLRALC runs.

Cure:	Just before adding to the fix-up chain, check the amount of core
	currently in use.  If too much, ignore RIPALC.  RIPALC will be zeroed
	on the next fast DSKCLN, or the next TITO all-files save, or the next
	time anyone does "DIR/WORDS", or any other operation that looks up
	all files.  This is edit 103 to DSKCLN 36J.

Subject: Hotline call 

System D31, 5:00pm-6:20pm, Dallas OPS, Lois @ 214-637-7435

Symptom: Files and UFDs disappeared or became unaccessable without any
         apparent reason.  Lois was running a MAGNUM procedure under
         (BILLING10) and got a fatal magnum error and couldn't proceed.

Problem: One of the disks had a SAT Failure just prior to the problems
         which occurred.

Solution: As per procedure setup by Tom Marconi, I told them to take the
          system down and run a full DSKCLN and call me back when it was
          complete.  DSKCLN went as expected, no failures were found and
          the system was back up an answered prior to 6:20pm when Lois
          called back.

Subject: THUNGs 

Writing files to the disk does not cause THUNG on 28.  Neither does running
TAKEIT by itself.  However, the HANG command to TAKEIT consistantly causes
BPC0 hung, BPC1 hung, etc.  Osman found it was always BPC, never BPA, even
though DSKB1,3,5,7, etc are on BPC.  Sounds like COMMON/MONBTS does not
do the right things when writing the modified HOME pages out.  This may be
related to the bogus "serious restart error" message.   /Joe

Subject: SUBMIT/XEXEC 

I'm putting the most current versions of XEXEC, EXECX and SUBMIT on SYS 
on all three of our machines (930, 62 and 95).  I believe that some of the
problems occurring with XEXEC et al are things which were "fixed" in one
of the latest versions.

Re: SUBMIT %1(205) supersedes SUBMIT %1(204)
Changes are to default the username field when a non-privileged user asks
for all jobs for his username or all jobs of name 'x' for his username,
and fix the bug where SUBMIT looped forever on deleted records until they
went away (and they didn't if XEXEC wasn't running).

Re: EXECX %1(222) supersedes EXECX %1(220)
Changes were to use the right default username when none was specified on
the :COM filename  command line.  Previously it was using the logged in job's
username (and the logged in job was EXECX running under OPER) and thus the
:COM command appeared not to work (unless you were OPER).

Dennis,
  Please review the "bugs" you asked me about concerning these areas and
check that the documentation conforms to the current behavior.  Let me know
if we need to make any additional changes to the wildcard/verify code.

Also not mentioned properly above... in EXECX, :TIME is now short for the
new :TIMELIMIT command and :TRULIMIT has been added.  In SUBMIT, "Y" now
works for "YES" in response to the verify prompt.  It was checking for the
entire word.

         Abdul did not call the beeper number, did not let Carl's phone ring

Symptom: System dies with FILAUU while doing TITO all-files with P035/B.

Problem: DECUMC called with P2 pointing to a job's dummy ATB instead of a real
         ATB.  FILAUU complains when it decrements some random JBT table to -1.

Solution: Ran DSKCLN 36J(103) in check mode - no problems reported.
         Gave them B39-P035/B01 since it has the FILAMO bug fix and it types
         out the ATB on FILAUU/FILAMO/FILAUS and related stopcodes.

TDERR.PAT has been applied to NEWMON on all systems.  It fixes the problem of
"serious restart error while writing to HOM pages".  The bug was: If the disk
is formatted in pages, MONBTS would set up to read in pages, and if the disk
was formatted in blocks, MONBTS would set up to read in pages.

I asked Osman to put in breakpoints - we found that the THUNGs occur when
TAKEIT kills job 2.  What sort of weirdness is CHKPNT up to?

Subject: ATTACH CHKPNT = THUNG. 

I was able to get hung disk messages by "SET OPR", "ATTACH 2".  CHKPNT
shutting down caused a THUNG on BPA4 and HUNG on BPC0,1,2,3,4,5,6.  It looks
like I/O was in progress on BPA4, that's why it got THUNG instead of HUNG
(the T means "while transfer was in progress").  Maybe releasing the ACT:
device causes PI channel 3 to get zapped.  It shouldn't though.  /JMS

Subject: THUNGs located. 

CHKPNT does a "read and reset buffered log" STRUUO on every unit in order
to log all accumulated disk errors.  It does all 14 units one right after
another - the BPC units return a busy flag, but for some reason do not
return the un-busy flag.  (Probably because BPA0 and BPC0 are the same
physical unit.)  There is no other-volume logic in FILIO for this UUO yet.
Until it is, I have modified CHKPNT to HIBER for 1/8 second between requests.
This should give the 3674 plenty of time to return the buffered log.  /JMS

Subject: CUPC testing 

I rebuilt a 2-pack test system from OSMAN's all-files tape in his office
and more current files from C70's recent all-files.

I made a 1.005 tape copy (1 plus a little) with TITO of that system.

I ran my new ASP to make a save set, did a compare with some interessting
results, (works 99.9% but a small but variable number of pages appears to
be different without apparent discomfort to the file system.

Attempted a second save set but had hardware problems reading from disk...
used the original ASP save to restore to one of the disks in the 2-pack
system and a second one to replace the "bad" one.  Did a compare on the
restored data and it matches, (all except 2 pages... no explanation, one
was obviously a .REL file page, and the other was miscellaneous bits).

Ran a FULL DSKCLN with 36J(103) after the all-files rebuild, after the
ASP asp restore and prior to coming up as X12.  NNo complaints from any
of the DSKCLN runs.

COnclusion:
  CPXKON appears to work in blocks on 3330's.  No load testing was done
          other than ASP.  It would be a good test to run a few ASH jobs
          at once to see what it does...
  ASP 13(101) appears to do everythng it is supposed to do. One check is
          still needed for restart verification of the disk page and for
          starting too near the end of the structure, but that can be
          done later.
  X12 is up, open for users/testing. 32xb01.sav

Symptom:  Initialization failure, NO USER for JOB DSKCLN.  Apparently
          the previous problem reported to Joe, cannot GFD etc., may have
          been caused by a bad LUD.SYS in (SYS).  No speculation on the
          co-incidence of the cache-directory-parity error.

Problem:  As in symptom above.  (SYS)LUD.SYS appears to have been modified
          by some unknown agent:  hardware? validations?  who knows...

          After attempting "PPN username" for OPER, CARL, SPL and others it
          seemed like a hardware glitch or some other one-time fluke that
          had wiped out part of the disk/ufd's.  I started a full DSKCLN and
          after Steve Atwell mentioned that he had done the same with no
          real errors, I aborted that and tried "DIR [1,21]" which printed
          a nice neat directory.  I then tried my own ppn and SPL.  Hmmm.

          I renamed LUD.SYS to LUD.BAD, copied it back to LUD.SYS for TITO
          and restored the file from the Saturday all-files tape.  All the
          "missing" UFD's were now restored and I had operations halt the
          machine and do a full DSKCLN.

Subject: CHKPNT 

Well,
  apparently CHKPNT %31(102) to whit we have in CHKPNT.CAB is in some
unfinished state (as of 24-Jun-85).  It is NOT worth the effort at this
time to figure out what needs to be finished.  There is code commented
out (as if waiting for more to be written) which looks suspiciously like
the code to prevent CHKPNT from dying when it runs out of space.  I put
in the code that Joe installed in his version 30.4 (I had a 30.4 at one
point but removed the edit because it didn't work as expected) as version
%31(103) now in CHKPNT.CAB in (OSU:930).

  The old %31(102) is now in (osu:930)CHKPNT.312.  Neither this file nor
CHKPNT.CAB will assemble in their current states and I expect to spend no
furhter time working on them until the other 365x work is completed.

  Tomorrow I will look at ASP in more detail and see about scheduling time
on the test machine(s) in Fremont (or Cupertino).

The new version is (OSU)CHKPNT.SAV everywhere; source is in (OSU:930)CHKPNT.304.
930 and 62 are running version 31(100) checksum MEFFAX, source unknown.

I'm going home from CUPC soon... and don't expect to come to the office
today.  I will try to go through the output I've generated on the 3330
disks running ASP and summarize it for our meeting.

The results (in my opinion) are inconclusive.  I only used the NEW ASP
and I only used the 32xb01.sav monitor Joe built for 3330 blocks length
command list.

I did NOT have a single run where everything matched.  Some pages were
different each time, and on multiple compares, the different pages
changed.  I do NOT like this at all.  I do NOT suspect ASP as the culprit
but I have no better explanations.

CPXKON is in 32xb01.sav that I used.  It is worth testing again later
with BPXKON to see if there are any differences (or patterns).

Subject: Running SUBMIT on the 2020s. 

P034/P-10 is the latest monitor supported on the KS machines.  SUBMIT will
not run on the P034/P monitor.  SUBMIT requires P034/P37 or P035/B.
P035/B cannot be supported on the 2020 until KSFEFS is modified to put
BOOTS in the right place on disk.

There are no software conflicts between P034/N and P034/P, which means that
S59, S60, S92, S264, S301, and Mallenkrodt's M169 can be upgraded with no
problems.  S443 is running P034/K which may be a hassle.  Upgrading W1051
will take as much effort as upgrading TRW from P034/J to P034/P.

I would like to see all of the 2020 systems upgraded to P034/P or better
by the end of June 1987.

Subject: Hotline Calls 

Tuesday,
  4 or 5 calls - all related to system 35's problems.
  problem eventually solved as per my previous messages.

Thursday,
  2 calls (so far) - system F74, Bonnie

  Problem.  System had one or more SAT failure messages on OPR or CTY
after which some files became inaccessible (SYSTAT for one) and they
reloaded.  Accounting under username APACCT complained of RIB errors
both before and after the reload.

  One file in their directory had a bad rib.  2 in TAPELIB.  I ran FNDBAD
and it generated a list of files with HRE and the three files mentioned
above without saying what was wrong with the three files.  It turned out
these are bad ribs.  (Joe, FNDBAD ought to say what is wrong!)

  2nd call was from Tim (Jim?) in Freont because he couldn't restoer the
files which had RIB errors.  Even with license he couldn't delete them.
I told him about the DELETE FILE.EXT/BAD command/switch and the files
were deleted ok.

Symptom: DSKCLN gave error "Bad rib detected in critical file"
         It listed (SYS)1022F.SHR and (SYS)DIRIT.SHR wtih WHC which means
         the entries had the wrong hash code.
I deleted both files and told operations to run a FULL DSKCLN and then
to restore the files from the all-files.

I ran DSKCLN in checking mode twice. Once before and once after
the files were deleted.

Subject: Update on hotline call 

Rerun of DSKCLN in checking  mode found additional files also bad...
so I looked at the UFD and found page 4 had what looked like blocks
2,3 and 4 copied to blocks 1,2 and 3.  All the rest of the pages looked
OK.  I BLTed the data to the right phase and erased the duplicate data.
Ran full dskcln in checking mode and intend to turn the system over
to operations to come up with REFLAG set and restore all of SYS from the
previous all-files/backup tapes using MODE SYS NEWEST after first doing
a full dskcln.


DSKCLN is running clean at the moment.

MAGSTS is tape drive status, CRS1 in the RH11 connected to the TM02/TU45.
100000 = bit 15 = SC   = Special condition (set if TRE or MCPE get set)
 40000 = bit 14 = TRE  = Transfer Error
 20000 = bit 13 = MCPE = Massbus Control Parity Error (TM02 sent bad parity)
  4000 = bit 11 = DVA  = Device Available (tape is on-line)
   200 = bit 07 = RDY  = RH11 is Ready (should always be on in any dump)

Crashes 020, 021, 024, 025, 026, and 029 all indicate that there is something
wrong with the tape drive.  The problem appears to only occur after EOT has
been reached.  Field Service needs to run diags on the drive - tell them
"We keep seeing bit 13 get set in register CSR1 of the tape's RH11".

On another subject, crashes 004, 006, 007, 011, 012, 013, 014, 016, 017, 018,

Differences between P034/P-10 and P034/P-14 monitors:
  Patch #11 RESET.PAT did not solve anything (SIMUUF still occurs)
  Patch #12 cancels the gobbler after zap (crashed EBUS bases, not LSI-11)

  Patch #14 made INFO stopcodes work on KI (does not affect KL or KS)

Subject: Fremont power failure 

The fremont data center took a power failure tonight... so if
you're wondering why some of the machines were down that is why.

No hotline call... I was curious why I couldn't build circuits to
any fremont hosts, but Dallas was up... sigh.

Subject: Product distribution proposal 

In the past, there have been various schemes to push files around to
one or more systems in order to keep software versions up to date.  Some
of these schemes involved people time to verify that the system was up
and running, that the proper software was being distributed, that the
proper license and protection were propagated and... and... and...

Most of these systems were too time intensive to work without someone
keeping track of what was happenning.  All of these systems relied on the
distribution of products from the source system to each of the destination
systems.  Most of these systems have fallen into disuse and much of what is
now running on our systems is not properly supportable.

I would like each of you to think about the ramifications of a replacement
distribution system that relies on pulling the software from the source
system automatically whenever it detects a discrepancy between the released
version of the product and the available version.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------

In thinking over the new SETOP database which will be centralized on one
host and how the individual changes would be distributed, some rather new
and obvious solutions came to mind.  If it was the responsibility of each
host to update it's OPER database, all changes could be marked on the
central system whose only responsibility would be to notify the outlying
systems that they needed to pull an update.

This same idea could be utilized in a software product distribution scheme
where product information is kept in one or more centralized places with
proper authorization for license and access to specific directories.  Each
individual system would have a similar "stripped-down" database which has
only the information needed by that system.  This individual database would
be updated by authorized users (or programs) whenever a new release is made.
The master database would have copies of the information for verification
and tracking purposes (including an audit trail).

Periodically, an XEXEC subjob would check to see that the software on the
system matched the database.  Any discrepancies would generate a separate
subjob to re-install the proper software with the correct license, protection
and checksums.  Mail would be sent to the appropriate authorized users for
any action taken (eg. Changing license or protection, restoring the file
from the source, requesting the file from the latest backup, etc).

The hierarchy of authorized users could be product managers, operations,
security people and the like.  I've begun to put together a list of needed
information about products, people and systems and I would appreciate
greatly any comments on the idea.

Since the security aspect is linked into the new SETOP, I will be making
my initial concentration in that area (two stones with one bird).

saying which other file had crossed SAT.SYS with multiply used page.  Bug.
The RIB to INITIA.SAV gotset to 777777777777 because of wrong SAT.
Luckily ther was INITIA.22 on SYS which could be renamed.  DSKCLN started
for real at 9:35 CDT, finished at 10:26, and found 12 files in SYS with
bad self-pointers in their RIBs.  DSKCLN put the names in RECOV.SYS saying

Hello Joe..

Remember the crashes on D55 last weekend right after rebuild on
3652 disk. Running with /B03 monitor they were keep crashing with
GTSAP1 STCODE. System would not run more than hour or so.

When operation try to bring F26 up with /B03 this mornning, system
crashed with GTSAP1 and crash is saved. System is now up with
SYSTEM which is /B01.

Only crash saved is on F26. The ones on D55 could not be saved because
of CRASH.SAV being 0 word long and BOOTS not quite working.

Subject: Micronode 2346 

Yesterday, I took an LSI-11/03-SE box and a BA11-ME box from the 2020 rack
and substituted the DUV-11 and DRV-11 cards from 2346 into it.  It is now
in the network as node 2346 and has been up for 20+ hours so far.  The old
LSI-11/03-LJ box is sitting on the table in the lab.

The new 2346 has the processor and memory boards that were in the box in
the 2020 rack... so, we have verified that it is not any of the communications
boards rthat were causing the problems.  We have not eliminated either the
11/03-LJ box itself (power supply etc) or the cpu and memory boards that
were in the old box.  We can worry about that later.... for now we have a
working network.

Subject: 2020 Progress (Cough) 

Some progress has been made in getting the 2020 up and running...
however, not enough...

1) By swapping the RH11's we can boot from magtape on UBA1/RH=776700
2) We have a KS1LOD.DMP file which uses UBA1 and the first RH.
3) We can load in the monitor.

after swapping the RH11s back to their original positions, we can start
to bring the system up... however, we get a PAGEME (using KSXN13) or an IME
stopcode.  IME in FILIO @ ERRRCV+12/LDB T2,PGYPNO  just after LDB PG,UNYPAC.
THis is the normal case.  If I load DDT and try to single step, or put in a
breakpoint at ERRRCV+anything it prints $n>> and then falls into the infinate
loop printing the "Manual restart from 147" message without printing any of
the stopcode info.

  All of this happens just when I try to enter FILES... I haven't gotten far
enough to even try to refresh the disks.

  The above error got me thinking maybe one of the drives/packs has a problem
so I moved the plugs around and tried a single pack (the one that had gotten
the home page inconsistancy errors) and the stopcode PCBIO(FINPCB+13) started
occurring.  At this point, I'm stopping for the evening.

Joe: If you have any ideas... let me know via MAIL, or call in the afternoon.

  And another thing... we only have 448K of memory (7 of 8 boards) in the
machine... are we missing one? is it out for repair? does anyone know?

Craig: Any help we can get on getting the other RH11 fixed, or the memory
       checked out... I doubt these stopcodes are all software problems...
       also that first drive, write-locked lamp...

1) I have the documentation from Dennis Ernst in my office.  He believes

   probably have the card repaired by them, thus giving us our full DR-11
   link capability for our network.

Subject: Incidental location costs 

Craig,
  Dennis Ernst tells me we can not expect to run our DUV-11 or DUP-11 line
at speeds greater than 9600.  The devices will do 19.2, but the software and
the LSI-11 cannot handle the interrupts at those speeds... in fact they are
often having data over-runs at 9600 due to the single interrupt capability
in the 11/03.

  If we assume we are to house our machines 1.5 miles away from our normal
workplace with no actual operational support, is anyone taking into account
the reduced productivity caused by having to drive that 3 miles, parking 2
times (assuming that the light rail does not extend that far?), or the cost
of having to drive or take public transportation just to reload our hosts
or the micro-bases?

  Or... the fact that we would more or less be unable to car pool on any
given day, (since we might need our own auto at any time to drive over to
our lab machines?)

  I realize that these qustions might seem picky, not to mention the extra
expense of communications, maybe forcing us to use more TYMNET resources on
the public net...  we might not actually save anything in the long run by
moving our machines to another site...  >>KICK<< >>TUMBLE<<  [soapbox just
forcibly removed from beneath my feet].

  Anyway, I think I've voiced what concerns that have come to haunt me.

Subject: Micronet and Host numbers 

I've talked to validations and tehy see no reason why we cannot use some of
the two-digit host numbers for our hosts.  I still need to check with Ed Roop
about using some of the old 940 host numbers (although Jan said we could use
36 after this weekend, and 57 at the end of May) such as 10 thru 21. If so,
we can then re-use 118, 930 and 934 for DZ-11 and DZV-11 devices on our net
so that we can build circuits to them from TYMNET.

More later... probably by meeting time on Wednesday.

Subject: Takeit %50 

I modified TAKEIT to continue even though it cannot access DSK or create
a LOG file.  (IF it can, it will.  If not, C'est la vie).

I also added code to set and clear KSYS.

Except for one small detail of the HOLD command (TAKEIT keeps an internal
counter and holds it steady, while the monitor KSYS counter doesn't have
the capability to "hold" at a specific value) which needs to be discussed
and implemented based on that discussion, TAKEIT %50 is ready for testing.

One possibility is for TAKEIT to reset the KSYS word in the monitor each
minute.  I put in the hooks and code for that, but it isn't quite turned
on (Need to move it to another location).

Another is that we set the sign bit, (only allowing 17 bits for the value)
and the sign-extended 18th bit says HOLD the current value.  (Since we do
not allow the monitor to go negative... true? [I didn't check]).

We can also change the SETUUO to use ac/ fn,addr   addr/ bits,,time
   or even better                    ac/ bits+fn,,time
   or add another setuuo or two... HOLD KSYS, CONTINUE KSYS

Subject: Cause of GTSAP1 stopcode in /A02, /A05, and /B03. 

There were two changes to SWAMP involved.  1) A DSKOFF instruction was moved to
avoid possible race conditions, and 2) better load balancing by putting new 
files on the unit with most space. 

The real problem was when the DSKOFF instruction was moved and the nearby
"JRST .-3" was not noticed.  The fix was to put a label at the right place and
jump to it.  The bug did not cause problems on a lightly loaded system, the
GTSAP1 crash occurred only when SAT I/O was in progress at the instant that
a new job tried to log in.

The second change caused SAT I/O to occur when new files were being created.
It forced the RIB of the new file to be created on the unit with the most
space instead of the SAT that happened to be in core.

Now that both changes are in and working properly, the monitor allocates disk
space better.  This should cause a noticable performance improvement when
DSKB is rebuilt from TITO all-files.   /Joe

TAKIET.SAI is nearly ready... but not quite... I've been pretty busy and
did not finish what I started.  %47 is back up on SYS.  Apparently TAKEIT
is doing something I don't see readily to keep the count internally even
with the changes I made for reading the cound from the monitor...  That is
all that needs to be fixed... (other than the documentation comments Joe
has already made, I didn't touch that yet).

See you all next month.

Subject: Status of 32XB03 and 32XB06. 

I spent this afternoon at Building-C trying to find out why 29XB03 worked but
32XB06 didn't.  TELECOPY would not work with 32XB03 either, until I made
32's CONFIG file look like 29's.  The only significant difference was
"XP JOBS,^D64" versus "XP JOBS,^D80".  I tried adjusting JOBS.  TELECO does
not work with JOBS set to 64, 72, 76, 77.  It does work with 78, 80, 108, 127.
I don't know why.  32XB06 works now that I set JOBS to 127 and added the
following to COMMON:
  IFCPU(<KI,KL>),<IFL JOBN-^D78,<
  PRINTX ? TELECOPY won't run with JOBS less than 78>>

Subject: Hack to BPXKON installed on 58. 

The unit data block has enough room in the command list to handle 18 blocks
(1 track).  If a request for several contiguous blocks starts in the middle
of the track, then it will hit the end of the track before it hits the end
of the command list.  A portion of the spaghetti code near TRNCNT is supposed
to handle this, switch to the next head, and continue adding until the
command list is full.  That is one of the places I was uncomfortable with.
By putting a JFCL at TRNCNT+3, BPXADD won't do any fancy footwork to fake out
FILIO.  It will simply take the non-skip return, which tells FILIO to not add
anything more until the transfer-done interrupt comes in for the current
request.  Then FILIO will resume with the next block (which need not be on
a page boundry).

I logged in to 58 to test this, and found it SHUT due to all the "hard" errors.
Without the patch, ASH got several errors within the first 7000 pages.  With
the patch installed, it got no errors.   I zeroed out the BAT blocks so we
and the CTY can see new entries.  /Joe

Subject: Found BPXKON bug for /B06. 

If the command list is big enough to hold 25 blocks, then there were cases
where BPXKON would transfer the last 2 blocks on one track, and then try to
transfer 23 blocks on the next track.  That does not work - 3675's have only
18 blocks.  BPXKON assumed that the command list was a certain size, and
never checked it.  The following is now in /B06 for systems with 3675 disks.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Rick, (415)498-2558, System F33.
Problem:  One of the new 3650 disks has hardware problems - kept going offline,
          now gets unit check one a particular cyl/surf/head.  PAKCOPY gets
          stuck there, even with sense switch two set.  Rick wanted to know
          if he should go ahead with ASSIGN and DEASSIGN to reformat that one
          track.  25 blocks will be lost, but the rest of the pack can then be
          copied.

Subject: F38 recovering from bad 3650 disk. 

System 38 had the HDA on BPA3 go bad.  PAKCPX had problems copying out the
pack due to "equipment check" on head 21 record 20 on 344 of the 555 cylinders.
I hacked at PAKCPX to get it to continue after such errors.  Rick Daniels read
the numbers to me over the phone, I wrote a quick program to create a DDT file,
and used TSTSUP on system 38 to create (JMS)BADPAG.MUP which had pointers to
all those pages in its RIB.  This caused DSKCLN to report the names of all the
files that were using those pages.  (JMS)FIX38.* shows what happened.  The end
result is FIX38.FIL (which was copied to (OPER:38)FIX38.FIL) which lists 274
files and 3 UFDs being damaged.  Restoring these files will be a lot quicker
than redoing the rebuild.  Time-in=02:18, time-out=12:31.   /Joe

Subject: WHEN program change 

TO make WHEN work correctly with ARGPAR, only switches may exist in the
SWITCH.INI file.  To make the OLD usage of WHEN work do the following:

Old:  WHEN  /MULTI CARL, OSMAN, JMS
New:  WHEN  /MULTI /USERS:CARL, OSMAN, JMS

You may also specify /USERS:xxx on the command line, but that defeats the
purpose of the command line and overrides it. SO, proper usage is:

WHEN user,user/switch
WHEN ?
WHEN

This works but the results are funny:

WHEN user1,user2/USERS:user3,user4

...this reports user3 and user4, completely ignoring user1 and user2.

Subject: System 38 will bring up P035/B07 tonight. 

I looked at the tracks left in the circular buffer and found a cause of
THUNGs.  There were several outstanding read requests, including one for unit
324.  When a request for 314 was added, for some reason it got a busy signal.
This is normal, the unit will be restarted when the not-busy signal comes in.
When the transfer on unit 324 finished, the not-busy signal came in as if it
were for units 320-327 instead of for units 300-317 as was expected.  Therefore
CPXKON tried to restart waiting units on BPB (unit 324 is BPB4), but not the
units on BPA (unit 314 is BPA14).  The THUNG was because unit 314 was not
restarted within 3 seconds.  Until we teach COMMOD and CPXKON that a single
controller (BPA) can have more than 16 disks, I put in a one-line hack that
restarts all waiting units when the not-busy signal comes in.  It will now find
any waiting unit, be it on BPA, BPB, BPC, or BPD.

Subject: Why /B07. 

Craig and Dennis:
  The previous message did not mention that the decision to create 38XB07
was made by Osman, Carl and myself.  The change is one line to CPXKON, but
is necessary to solve the THUNG problem on 38 and 3652 systems.  We also
decided that all systems currently running /B06 should come up on /B07 as
soon as possible.  The systems we scheduled to run /B06 next week will be
running /B07 at that time.

The correct fix (which will be after P035/C) will be to teach COMMOD and
CPXKON that there can be more than 2 strings on a controller.  The places
that currently store 16 flag bits in a halfword need to be modified to
handle 64 bits in two words.  Then update the CONFIG files so that systems
with many strings on a single physical controller show up as a single
logical controller.  In particular, system 38 will have BPA0-BPA27 instead
of BPA0-BPA17 + BPB0-BPB7, and systems with 3652s will have BPA0-BPA7 +
BPA40-BPA47 instead of BPA0-BPA7 + BPC0-BPC7.

The above change will make CPXKON aware of reality.  When it determines that
controller "BPA" is busy, it will correctly understand that the units on all
4 strings on that controller are busy.  Prior to /B07, CPXKON figured that
because the second 2 strings were assigned to "BPB", that it was a seperate
piece of hardware, and was not affected by "BPA" being busy.

I expect 38XB07 will not get any THUNGS.    /Joe

Subject: Microcycle clock 

The contents of JBTCMP,JBTCP2 are the low&high 2-word result of the
KL EBOX time (RDEACT instruction) since system startup.  JBTCMP(J) and
JBTCP2(J) contain the KL EBOX time per job, since login.

We currently throw away the MBOX time, by overwriting it with the EBOX
time.  ICP reports the total of the EBOX times for all jobs for the
interval taken, divided by the fraction of a second to give MCY/SEC.

SUBJECT>   Testing ASP (Version 7)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The weekend of 18 July this software will be tested on system 58.
Between now and then, 14 disk packs need to be set up to be used.

For the next few weekends, I will schedule this system down at 2400
on Friday nights until 0800, Saturday mornings.  The regular ASP dump
will be rescheduled for this timeframe.  The remaining time after the
dump is to be used to REFRESH, FORMAT, and INITIALIZE the packs.

On the weekend of 27 June, 7 packs will be done, or as many as possible,
and 7 packs the weekend of 4 July.  If the weekend of 11 July is needed to
finish up, it will be scheduled.  These packs will be identified and set
aside for use on 18 July.

On 18 July, the system will be scheduled down from 2400, Friday night
with a scheduled uptime of 2400, 19 July.

                                                                Page  2

During this time an ASP dump will be taken on F58 using (OSU)ASP.SAV
(Version 7) software.  After tapes have been verified, the system packs
will be taken off-line and put aside.

The packs that were set up previously will be put on-line.

After the file structure has been built, the ASP tapes will be restored.
After the restore, the system will be UNSHUT for users.

Any problems, a backup will be taken (if possible), and the packs will
be switched.

Please see me if questions.
