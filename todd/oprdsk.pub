.re |Operator Procedure for New DSKCLN|
.body; nofill

In monitors previous to P034/E DSKCLN was invoked after every crash and
ONCE auto restart to check the consistency of all RIBs and SATs in the
mounted structure.  This had a significant impact on system
availability.  Now with P034/E (and later) the capability exists to
ascertain which files were undergoing modification at crash time.  If
the crash did not occur because of a file system malfunction and no
serious file system errors were detected during the period of time that
the system was up (such as SAT errors) then DSKCLN can run in a new
mode called 'FAST' which only scans recently altered files.  If this is
not possible DSKCLN should run in 'FULL' mode (i.e.  do what the old
DSKCLN did).  In some cases, such as after a TAKEIT take-down that
terminates normally, and assuming a stable file system, DSKCLN can run
in mode 'NONE', that is, it need not check the structure at all.
Normally, the current monitor is capable of communicating to the next
monitor (via special core and disk areas set aside for that purpose)
the appropriate DSKCLN type to run.  If it is not able to do so the
operator will be prompted at the CTY to supply the DSKCLN type with the
message:

	DSKCLN MODE IS NULL
	DSKCLN TYPE DESIRED:

the next time the monitor is brought up.  The question should be
responded to with either 'FULL', 'FAST', or 'NONE' depending upon the
manner in which the previous incarnation of the monitor terminated:

	If the following occured:		Answer with:

	(1) Monitor not capable of supporting	NONE
	new DSKCLN was brought down successfully
	with TAKEIT to reload with P034/E or
	later

	(2) Memory parity crash			FAST

	(3) Processor hung			FAST

.GROUP
	(4) Received "KL FATAL PROCESSOR ERROR"	FAST
	message on CTY
.APART

	(5) Received "SEVERE ERR ENCOUNTERED:	FULL after hardware has
	HARDWARE SUSPECT" message on CTY	been checked out and/or
						repaired.

	(6) Received "BAD SAT" message on OPR	FULL
	terminal or CTY

	(7) Other				FULL

In general, regardless of the primary reason for a crash, if disk
subsystem errors have been detected, DSKCLN should always be run
in 'FULL' mode.  Additionally, FULL DSKCLN should be run periodically
to reclaim lost pages (i.e. pages marked in use but really free).

The mechanism described above has additional features not detailed
in this memo.  Please contact me or Ernie Socci if a situation
arises that cannot be handled by the information provided here.
