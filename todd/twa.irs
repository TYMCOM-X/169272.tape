We do not believe that the proposed change to our 1980 tax returns
"other income" is warranted.  The amount reported by the payer was
for a full fare unrestricted plane ticket.  The income received
was a restricted ticket with a much lower market value that we
determined by consulting the newspaper classified section.  

We request a conference with an examiner to explain our position.
