Subject:           Backspace As Break-On-Puncuation

In monitor versions P034/B and later, the break characteristics of
backspace are settable. If the "backspace-as-break-on-puncuation" bit
(the bit) is set, backspace counts as a punctuation character (it causes
a break only if enabled for break-on-puncuation); if the bit is cleared,
the default state, backspace always causes a break.  The bit can be set
and cleared by invoking the .AXBBP AUXCAL (function code 66) as shown
below:

              MOVE   ac, [port,,66]
              AUXCAL ac, addr

where <addr> points to either:
     1) a word containing a negative number, in which case
        .AXBBP reads the current value of the bit into
        c<addr>.
     2) a word containing a nonnegative number, in which case
        c<addr> bit 35 is swapped with the current setting
        of the bit.

The normal AUXCAL checks are performed.


Note that in order for backspace to be echoed on full-duplex terminals,
the "remote backspace echo" bit must be set.  This can be accomplished
with the .AXRBS AUXCAL.
