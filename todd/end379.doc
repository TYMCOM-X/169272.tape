Monitor Enhancements:

   Backspace As Puncation:                        5         100
      The break characteristics of backspace are
      now settable by invoking the new .AXBBP AUXCAL
      (function 66).  If the "backspace as punctuation"
      bit is set, backspace counts as puncuation,
      otherwise it is a break character.

   Virtual Peek/Poke:                             2         100
      Augmentation of PEEK, POKE, and BITPOK to
      handle virtual addresses.

   Soft Crashing Phase I:                        45          85
      Mechanism which enables extreme flexibility
      in user/monitor/operator selection of OS bring-
      up activities and which guarantees the validity
      of soft crashing code prior to execution.

         Design.

         Implemented new SETUUO function 12 (.REST)
         to read/write restart bits.  The restart bits
         define the manner in which a TYMCOM-10 will
         come-up after a crash/hang.

         Implemented new SETUUO function 11 (.BTSTR)
         to read/write BOOTS command string.

         Implemented a set of primitive drivers to read/
         write a page to a 3330 type device.

         Integration of above and supporting logic.

LOGINN Enhancement/Fix:                           1         100

   Fixed minor bug causing job num. prompt input to not
   be echoed when no project code required is set.

   Added bit to login stream record that is set if
   user logs in with shut override.

Maintenance:                                      5           -
   Crash analysis and logging.

Training:                                         5           -
   Further exploration of monitor internals, use of
   KL-10 simulator, SA-10 3330 details, sundry other
   programs.

Two unexpected events have impeeded development efforts this
quarter: 2020/KI,KL smerge and the neccessity of writing the
primitive 3330 drivers.
