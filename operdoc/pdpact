FILE SECURITY AND CERTAIN BILLING PURPOSES.
^THE <UUN PROVIDES EACH USER WITH A NUMBER WHICH IS UNIQUE TO THAT USER

IT TOOK THE PLACE OF USERNAMES.
^FOR THIS REASON, SEVERAL OF THE <DEC SUBSYSTEMS WHICH ARE STILL
IN USE BY <MDC ^OPERATIONS REQUIRE THAT A <PPN BE USED RATHER THAN
A USERNAME. 
^THE TWO MOST COMMONLY USED SUBSYSTEMS REQUIRING <PPN'S ARE <PIP
