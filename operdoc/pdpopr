^THE <TYMCOM-X OPERATING SYSTEM HAS AN AUTOMATIC RELOAD CAPABILITY
WHICH WILL OCCUR SO LONG AS SENSE SWITCH 4 ON THE <KI CONSOLE IS OFF (THE NORMAL SETTING).
^WHEN THE MONITOR GOES TO A '<BOOTS <LOADED' CONDITION IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY
DO WHAT THE OPERATOR WOULD NORMALLY DO: PERFORM A /^D (DUMP) TO MOVE THE CRASH TO THE DISK
AND A (CARRIAGE-RETURN) TO RELOAD THE MONITOR. ^IF THIS SUCCEEDS A PROGRAM CALLED <INITIA
DOES MOST OF THE CONTROLLING OF WHICH JOBS ARE THEN RUN IN THE AUTO-RESTART
SEQUENCE.
.SKIP 1

INPUT BEFORE CONTINUING.
^IF YOU WISH TO DUMP THE CRASH TYPE '/^D (CARRIAGE RETURN).
^THEN TO LOAD THE MONITOR TYPE ANOTHER CARRIAGE RETURN.
^IF SENSE SWITCH 4 IS STILL ON, THE MONITOR WILL BRANCH TO THE <ONCE <ONLY
CODE (SIGNIFIED BY A '>').

^IF INSTEAD THE WORD '<STANDALONE' IS TYPED, THE SYSTEM RESTART PROCESSES AND

HAS NOT ACTUALLY BEEN SAVED TO A FILE WITH <COPYCR, AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED
AND THE /^D WILL BE ABORTED.
^THEN BOOTS WILL GO BACK TO COMMAND LEVEL AND ALLOW THE
OPERATOR TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO OVERWRITE THE PREVIOUS CRASH DUMP
OR NOT WRITE A CRASH FILE (THAT IS, NOT OVERWRITE THE PREVIOUS CRASH DUMP).
^THE GENERAL GUIDELINES ARE 1) IF THE SYSTEM CRASHES AND THEN CRASHES
AGAIN DURING BRINGUP, DUMP THE ORIGINAL CRASH (THAT IS, DO NOT OVERWRITE
IT WITH THE SECOND CRASH);
2) IF THE SYSTEM CRASHES AND THERE IS A DUMP FROM SOME EARLIER UNDETERMINED
TIME, THEN DUMP THE CURRENT CRASH (OVERWRITE THE EARLIER UNDETERMINED CRASH
DUMP).

^THE SECOND MEMORY CAUSED HANGUP CONDITION IS INDICATED BY THE

SYSTAT is a versatile Tymshare utility program
on the TYMCOM X system.  It displays at a terminal extensive and
detailed information about activity on the TYMCOM X system 
at any time.

This document supersedes all other Tymshare documentation of
SYSTAT and all DEC documentation of SYSTAT which has
been used by Tymshare.
.SKIP 1
((COMAND SUMMARY))
.SKIP 1
SYSTAT is called from the Monitor or Executive mode
with a command in the following general form:
.NOFILL.NOJUST
.SKIP 1
-SYSTAT [search command][job status control command(s)]
	[system information control command(s)]
.INDEX <SYSTAT <COMMAND <FORMAT

.FILL.JUST
.SKIP 1
where the bracketed portions are any of those commands listed
in the COMMAND DESCRIPTION below.
Any SYSTAT command can be abbreviated to
the shortest form which distinguishes it from any other SYSTAT
command.  In this manual, a carriage return completes a command
unless stated otherwise.

SYSTAT will, in general, print a preamble followed
by a summary of activity and then return to the executive.  The
various commands given to SYSTAT when calling it as well as the
license of the user determine the type and quantity of
information which is printed.  The SYSTAT program
leaves the terminal in the Executive or Monitor mode
throughout the operation of the program.
The activity summary is a combination of the optional reports that
can be obtained from SYSTAT.  These are a job status
display and numerous other system information displays that are
selected by the user.
.SKIP 1
The following commands to the Monitor also access
SYSTAT:

subject to the options selected.

SYSTAT license is required to obtain some of the system
information such as swapping statistics and complete disk
status reports and to get a job status report on jobs outside
one's own GAN.  Performance statistics that are reported
will not reflect the total system load if the user has inadequate license to
obtain the necessary information.

Read files license is necessary to obtain all the file information
