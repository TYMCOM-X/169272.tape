^THE FILES DIALOGUE IS USED TO EXAMINE AND CHANGE PARAMETERS OF THE

ENTERED.  ^THE FIRST WAY IS FOR THE ^OPERATOR TO SET SENSE SWITCH 4 AND
GIVE THE COMMAND <"FILES" WHEN THE PROMPT <"ONCE>" IS TYPED.

^THE OTHER METHOD IN WHICH THE FILES DIALOGUE IS ENTERED IS AS A RESULT
OF ERRORS DETECTED IN THE <"HOME" BLOCKS ON THE DISK AS THE SYSTEM IS 
BROUGHT UP.  ^THE <"HOME" BLOCKS STORE INFORMATION ABOUT
THE CONFIGURATION OF THE DISK SYSTEM.

OF THE CONDITION.  ^THE <"SECOND" CLASS CONTAINS THOSE ERRORS WHICH MAY NEED
FIXING, BUT WHICH THE SYSTEM CAN <"LIVE <WITH".  ^THESE ARE ERRORS SUCH
